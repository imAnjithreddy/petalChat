The Skittles switch began in late March and wraps up in September.\nThe move has received a mixed reaction on social media. Some Twitter users like it, but others are critical of the selection of white for the campaign, saying it plays against the nod to diversity.\n  Business Nation/World Associated Press",

While it does not show anybody getting shot, it is still absolutely terrifying. \nThe shooter, who has since been identified as James Hodgkinson , a leftwing activist-turned-criminal from Bellville, Illinois, opened fire on the GOP Congressional baseball team in the DC suburb of Alexandria, Virginia, on Wednesday morning around 7 a.m. The team was practicing for Thursday’s charity game against the Democratic Congressional baseball team at Nationals Park, an annual tradition dating back to 1909. \nFive innocent people were shot in the attack, including House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise . Hodgkinson was eventually shot by Scalise’s security detail, which included members of the Secret Service and the Capitol Police. He later died at a local hospital. \nTwo videos of the gun battle have now been released. \nThe first, obtained by the New York Post , was shot by a witness at Eugene Simpson Park. It shows law enforcement officers moving around and firing at Hodgkinson in the distance. It also shows someone lying down in the middle of the baseball field, trying to avoid getting shot: \nThe second video, obtained by The Hill , was shot in the backyard of a nearby Alexandria resident. You can’t see what’s going on at the field, but you sure can hear it: \nAbsolutely terrifying. \nScalise, who was reportedly shot in the hip, underwent surgery on Wednesday morning. Though his office initially indicated he was in stable condition, it is now being reported that he is in “critical” condition and may require more surgery.  ",

      "text": "Jose Calderon’s Warriors Career: $207,500 Per Hour, 0 Minutes, NBA Championship by: Black Adam Schefter   Golden State Warriors Jose Calderon \nBack in March, Jose Calderon was just minding his business being a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, until they decided to waive him. \nThe Golden State Warriors decided to pick him up, but Kevin Durant suffered a possible season-ending knee injury shortly after and the team felt they needed a taller player to fill Durant’s role. The team wanted Matt Barnes to fill that role, but instead of just not signing Calderon, the Warriors signed him, then waived him two hours later. \nCalderon made $415,000 for his 119 minutes as a member of the team. That’s $207,500 per hour. \nWarriors sign Matt Barnes, waive Jose Calderon. But there was still this jersey outside of the visiting locker room in Chicago: pic.twitter.com/EKUFUlMUZM \n— Michael Singer (@msinger) March 2, 2017 \nThe best part about this entire ordeal is that Jose Calderon is now an NBA Champion. Since he was a part of the team at one point in the season, the Warriors are eligible to give Calderon a championship ring. \n\n— M-️reezy (@slimsisky) June 13, 2017  ",

      "text": "Teal Bunbury hoping big US Open Cup performance kickstarts his MLS campaign June 15, 2017 11:13AM EDT \nPROVIDENCE, R.I.—As Teal Bunbury gave his postgame interview on Wednesday night, the chorus rang down from New England Revolution supporters’ groups Midnight Riders and The Rebellion. \n“Not blue, not green, he’s somewhere in between. He’s Teal!” \nIt was a welcomed scene for the New England attacker, who scored a goal and helped setup another at Providence College in what was ultimately a 3-0 win over the Rochester Rhinos in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Fourth Round. \nThe 27-year-old, who’s fresh off a two-game suspension for violent conduct against the New York Red Bulls on May 27, said the performance does wonders for his confidence. \n“I feel like my confidence is always there, but it’s great to score goals,” Bunbury said. “I want to contribute, whether it’s assisting or scoring goals. But it definitely feels good to get a full, 90-minute game in. I haven’t played much of late, so I’m trying to do everything I can in training, and when I get my opportunity, make the most of it.” \nAs Bunbury mentioned, he’s struggled to leave a mark on the Revs’ 2017 campaign, failing to register a goal or an assist in nine appearances, all from the bench. Thrust into a reserve role, Bunbury said he hopes to parlay his Open Cup exploits into more MLS playing time. \n“For me, I want to play every minute of every game, and that’s the way I train,” Bunbury said. “When I get my chance, I try to make the most of it, but I know it’s very competitive. That brings out the best in everybody.” \nAn increased workload for Bunbury ultimately rests in the hands of head coach Jay Heaps, but the Minnesota native boosted his case on Wednesday, playing wide right against Rochester. A target winger during his earlier days, Bunbury has predominantly played up top this year in the Revs’ 4-4-2 diamond formation. \nWhichever spot comes his way, Bunbury certainly caught the eye of Heaps. \n“I think Teal keeps going,” Heaps said. “For me and the entire team, Teal is right on the cusp and continues to push. He’s someone we need as we continue through this stretch.” \nHeaps will no doubt have to rotate his squad a bit in the coming weeks, as Wednesday’s match kicked off a three-week stretch in which the Revs will play six matches across all competitions. Bunbury said he hopes the busy schedule can help kick start the Revs, perhaps igniting another deep Open Cup run for the 2016 tournament runner-ups, for whom Bunbury hopes to play a pivotal role. \n“This is huge not just for me, but for other guys who might not be getting a lot of opportunities and minutes in regular season play,” Bunbury said. “Like I’ve said, we have a deep enough team that we could win this whole thing. That’s our motivation.”",

      "text": "Summer vacation? Lots of Americans say they can't afford it Posted: By BETH J. HARPAZ and EMILY SWANSONAssociated Press \nForget frequent flier miles, last-minute getaways and even road trips. Nearly half of Americans say they won't be taking a vacation this summer, mostly because they can't afford it, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. \nThe new AP-NORC survey, conducted in May, said 43 percent of Americans won't be taking a summer vacation. The top reason for skipping a trip was the cost, cited by 49 percent of non-vacationers. Another 11 percent said they can't take the time off from work, while 3 percent said they don't like to be away from work. \nAbout half of Americans living in households making less than $50,000 a year don't plan to take any summer vacation this year, and they're especially likely to cite costs as a reason. \nAnd if your employer gives you paid vacation days, consider yourself lucky: Forty-one percent of those surveyed who work full or part time said they do not get any paid time off from their employers to use for vacation. Younger and lower-income workers are especially likely to not get any paid time off. \nDanny Aguilar of Lakewood, Colorado, says the cost is what stops him from planning a vacation. He works in information technology, but because he's self-employed, \"the income is very unknown. You don't know what's going to happen. You never really know what's coming. You can't really budget.\" \nOther findings from the poll: \n-Most Americans use at least some of their paid time off if they have the option, but many still leave paid vacation days on the table. Fourteen percent of workers who get paid vacation time from their jobs did not use any of the days they had coming to them. Just half of those with paid vacation time used up all or most of the days they were entitled to in the past year. \n-Not everybody wants to go away in the summer. Fifteen percent of those who are passing on a summer getaway say it's because they already took a vacation this year or because they'll travel some other time of year. \n-Americans seem to value time over luxury when it comes to their vacations. Nearly two-thirds say they'd prefer to take a longer but less luxurious vacation over one that's shorter but more luxurious. \nLinda Dube and her sister are among those citing cost as a reason for staying home this summer. The sisters, who are retired, live in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, and usually vacation for a few days at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. \"We decided this year, instead of doing that, we'd save a little money and take a one-week staycation,\" she said. They plan a day at a local mall, eating out at a \"wonderful little diner in the next town\" and perhaps a trip to a nearby art museum. Dube's sister is in a wheelchair, she added, so any destination must accommodate wheelchairs. \nDavid Kisler of Costa Mesa, California, says he can't afford a vacation either. \"I'm working three jobs to make ends meet,\" said Kisler, who lost his job marketing network security in 2009. His wife works, too, but he said they've been dipping into savings to tackle projects around the house. \nKisler and his wife did recently drive to Mission Beach in the San Diego area to spend time with family who'd driven in from Arizona, but three days with relatives in a shared rental house is \"not exactly a vacation,\" he said. \nMore than 4 in 10 Americans say they don't consider visiting family to be a true vacation, though about three-quarters do consider a long weekend away a vacation. \nFor Kisler, the weekend in a shared house with family certainly can't compare with the week he and his wife spent a few years ago in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in a hotel near the beach. \"That was a real vacation,\" he lamented. \n___ \nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,022 adults was conducted May 10-14 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.3 percentage points. \nRespondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods and later interviewed online or by phone. \n___ \nAP-NORC: http://www.apnorc.org/  ",

Bill Cosby arrives at the Montgomery County Courthouse during his sexual assault trial, Thursday, June 15, 2017, in Norristown, Pa. \nNORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) - The Latest on the sexual assault trial of Bill Cosby (all times local): \n8:50 a.m. \nBill Cosby has arrived for the fourth day of jury deliberations in his sexual assault trial. \nJurors have been debating the charges against Cosby for more than 27 hours since getting the case Monday. Deliberations will resume Thursday morning. \nThe trial outside Philadelphia involves Cosby's sexual encounter with a woman at his home in 2004. \nAccuser Andrea Constand says Cosby drugged and molested her. He says he gave her an over-over-the-counter cold and allergy medicine to help her relax and that the encounter was consensual. \nThe charges could put the 79-year-old entertainer in prison for the rest of his life if he's convicted \n___ \n1:45 a.m. \nAs deliberations in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial continue into a fourth day, nerves are frayed, patience is shot and no one is certain when it will all end. \nJurors return to the deliberation room Thursday morning, but the long road to a verdict is taking a toll. \nSome jurors appeared angry and even the judge has sounded exasperated at times. \nThe sequestered jury has been at it for more than 27 hours since getting the case Monday. \nThey've paused a half-dozen times to revisit key evidence, including Cosby's decade-old admissions that he fondled accuser Andrea Constand after giving her pills at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. \nThe Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Constand has done.

      "title": "Andre Ward vs. Sergey Kovalev 2 Undercard Quotes",
      "text": "  \nOn Wednesday, June 14, the televised undercard of Andre Ward vs. Sergey Kovalev 2: “The Rematch” sat down to participate in roundtables with the media during Fight Week Powered by Monster. Head trainers Virgil Hunter (Team Ward) and John David Jackson (Team Kovalev) followed the group of boxing talent with respective round tables of their own. Ward-Kovalev 2: “The Rematch” will take place Saturday, June 17 at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. The championship event, presented by Corona Extra, will be produced and distributed live by HBO Pay-Per-View® beginning at 9:00 p.m. ET/6:00 p.m. PT. \nBelow is what the participants had to say: \nVirgil Hunter, Trainer of Andre Ward \n“[Andre’s] ring IQ speaks for itself but the worst mistake you can make is to underestimate the opponent’s IQ. We take it all the way to the top, whoever we’re fighting. The mindset is you’re the best in the world. You’re the best that ever did it. You don’t want to stop the bar on eight when you can go all the way to 10. The bar is set at 10 in giving Sergey the credit that he rightfully deserves. Look, I’ve said it before, but I’m a Sergey Kovalev fan. Just not this fight. But I’m a fan of his. I knew a long time ago that if we ever moved up to light heavyweight that we would meet. I understood that a long time ago. \n“You can never tell what’s going on in a fighter’s mind. I tend to let Andre set the tone. If we have to change it up, then I’ll come in and we might change up a few things. But he’s been doing it so long and I trust him. I know exactly what I’m looking at when he’s fighting. He can set the tone. If the frustration becomes an asset for us, we’ll stay there and keep him frustrated. \n“Me knowing Andre’s mindset and how he approaches things, I told him that we’ll train for a knockout. It doesn’t mean it’s going to come, but we’ll train for it. It’ll be quite evident in the fight. He’s going to get hit because you got to get hit to win and get knockouts. He’s been hit by Sergey and he described the punches just as I see the punches on TV, very sharp… not concussive but sharp. [A knockout] is a possibility. I’ve only trained Andre to purposefully knock out somebody twice – the first one was Chad [Dawson], the second one was this one. I never trained him to knock anybody out, but those two I did. Only twice have we changed strategy to stop somebody. \n“What we want to do is make sure Sergey doesn’t get the flush punch. He might graze you, he might rush punch, he might punch you like ‘get off me’ as opposed to being planted and zeroed in and ‘boom’ give him that shot. Sergey never landed another punch after the knockdown. So, if Andre was hurt, how could he make Sergey miss? All you got to do is watch it after the knockdown. \n“I’ll have to take Sergey at his word, but when I look at the fight, I just don’t see where he got tired. He continued to throw and he continued to press. I don’t see personally where he got tired and I think I can identify fatigue in a fighter pretty well. But I have to take him at his word. \n“No, Andre never made any excuses about his fight. Look, it was a tough fight, a great fight. If you came to the fight and participated in the fight, you don’t have any excuses. I’m not making any excuses; I’m just saying we’re going to have a different fighter. That doesn’t guarantee victory or anything, just a different fighter.” \nJohn David Jackson, Trainer of Sergey “Krusher” Kovalev \nOn the first fight against Ward: \n“My opinion is the same now as it was that night: Sergey won the fight. If you look at the first half of the first fight Sergey dominated. If you look at the second half of the fight Ward got back in the game but Ward didn’t come back and dominate like the way everyone says he did. Especially with the knockdown, Sergey won the fight hands down but he unfortunately didn’t get the decision. For this fight, if he can fight the second half of this fight the way he fought the first half of the last fight, then of course we will win the fight. He has proved it publicly that he can outbox Ward at his own game. The question now is, can Ward come back and try to outbox Sergey at Sergey’s game? That is highly doubtful. Ward isn’t a big puncher and can he take Sergey’s body shot? We’ll see in the second fight what happens but if Sergey fights the second half of this fight the way he fought the first half of the last fight then he wins. I had the first half 5-1 or maybe 6-0 for Sergey but the second half I had it 3-3 or at best 4-2 for Ward. So, when you count in the knockdown, Sergey won the fight.” READ Berto sees Andre Ward stopping Sergey Kovalev \nOn whether it’s the game plan to knock out Ward: \n“No. Sergey needs to stick with his jabs and his combinations, put every round in the bank just like we did the first fight but in the second half he needs to sustain that attack. Don’t falter and he will win. If he goes for the knockout, he may not catch Ward. Ward is a very defensively sound-minded fighter. Sergey needs to be smart.” \nOn Sergey’s tiredness, late in the first fight: \n“There is a different conditioning coach now so hopefully that helps him physically as well as mentally. They seem to work well together. If he did his job than Sergey will be fine. For the first fight Sergey was running 14 miles a day and I asked him why. I told him he was going to wear his legs out. He is still running but not nearly as much. He is saving himself for this time around. I told him that although he was fatigued he hid it pretty well. I couldn’t tell that he was fatigued. He got a different coach for the conditioning part and that should work for him. If it works for him physically, it will help him mentally. And that is a tremendous blow to help him win this fight. Now that he has brought a new guy in let’s see if that is what he needed to be more successful in his pursuit of Andre Ward.” \nOn prediction for the fight: \n“I give Andre a lot of credit for being a very defensive-minded fighter. The fight might go the distance but that’s ok. We aren’t worried about that. If it goes the distance and Sergey does what he is supposed to do, he dominates; he should win hands down. Just think about this: if Sergey hadn’t slowed down and kept up the same pace he had, what would Ward have done differently? He would have gotten his ass whooped the same way because Sergey beat him in the first half of the fight the way he wanted to. Sergey slowed down and that allowed Ward to get back in the game. If he didn’t slow down, then what would Ward do? He would have still lost the second half of the fight the way he lost the first half. Sergey allowed him to get back in the game. He didn’t just do it; Sergey allowed him to get back in the game because he got tired.” \nOn the knockdown in the first fight: \n“I wasn’t surprised he got up because Sergey didn’t hit him flush. It was kind of a grazing shot. It wasn’t full with his knuckles. If Sergey had hit him with a solid shot, Ward probably wouldn’t have gotten up. He got hit with a shot that wasn’t solid.” \nOn changes for this fight: \n“We worked on the inside game. Both fighters held a lot and Sergey was to blame for that also. Now Ward thinks that he is going to hurt Sergey to the body and probably break him down. Well, guess what? If you watch Ward’s fights he grabs a lot. He is not a true inside fighter. He grabs a lot and he holds and hits with the free hand. As good as Sergey punches, do you think that he is going to stand there and take those kinds of punches to the body? No. Sergey’s mentality is different. He is a survivor-type fighter. He is defensively sound. Once he gets hit he is going to take off. He is not going to stand there and take those kinds of punches.” \nGuillermo Rigondeaux (17-0, 11 KOs), WBA World Super Bantamweight Champion \n“I can’t wait for Saturday night. The Mexican boxing community is going to be out there and every Mexican is ready for war, so we’re ready to put on a spectacular fight on Saturday. I believe my preparation has always been excellent and the Cuban school of boxing has always been something I’ve focused on. I believe, on Saturday, June 17, it will be shown. I train for one boxer at a time and when it comes, it comes. You just train hard all the time. No boxer intimidates me in any way. [Flores] is a good boxer and I’m impressed by his style, but I’m not intimidated by anyone. It’s a God-given gift to move [the way I do] in the ring and have the reflexes I have. It just kicks in. I go to work when I step into the ring. \n“I’m 122 pounds, I’ve always been at 122 but I’ll still beat anyone at 126. Weight isn’t really much of a big issue for me. I just want the big names and the big fights. For really good quality boxing, it’s not really about size. It’s more about heart, conditioning, speed, experience, excellence – everything I’ve gone through. We live everyday based on the results and the good work we put in. All the people are intimidated to get in the ring with me. READ Andre Ward Sweet Science Teacher \n“When you have two superstars like that – and two friends of mine – it’s hard to determine [who will win]. But they’re going to put on an excellent show on Saturday, June 17. Andre Ward will truly have to prove whether he’s the real champ and this is the real test.’ \nMoises Flores (25-0, 17 KOs), Interim WBA World Super Bantamweight Champion \n“I feel great; I’m level-headed. I’m trying to take advantage of the opportunity and do what I need to do. [Rigondeaux] being favored is not really a big deal. I’ve been the underdog during my last five fights, so this is nothing new to me. I understand the game. I’m humble; I’m OK with it, I’m ready. I’m ready to fight. \n“[My reach and height] is definitely an advantage. We’re definitely going to use that advantage – we just need to use it the right way. His age will play a part in [the fight], so we need to take advantage of it and my youth. But I’m sure he’s done his job in the ring and in the gym. But so have I. I think it will be one of the toughest fights of my career because of his boxing style. He operates from a distance, his legs are strong and he’s intelligent. He doesn’t have the same speed he once had, but he’s still fast. We just need to attack him and trap him. I think my boxing style can slow him down. \n“These are the opportunities you train for. He’s a boxer in every sense of the word. But what can he – or any rival – do to me that life hasn’t already done to me. [Rigondeaux] is the posterchild of a real boxer and, for all that, I give him credit. People talk because they love to see action, blood, a horror movie. They want to see combat. Rigondeaux has talked a lot and we’re going to confront him in the ring. There will be action, there will be blood. I work for that.” \nDmitry Bivol (10-0, 8 KOs) – Interim WBA Light Heavyweight Champion \nOn changing opponents from Sullivan Barrera to Cedric Agnew, a Southpaw: \n“Any fight with any level opponent can create problems for a fighter. This is boxing and anything can happen. I think that if I follow the plan that we have set everything is going to be good. I am definitely glad with the way things have gone now. It is my 11th fight and I am glad to be fighting on such a big event on HBO Pay-Per-View. It is a great honor. It is a great achievement for me. We have set certain goals with my manager, my trainer, my promoter and the rest of my team and so far, everything is going by the plan. I am very glad that everything is going the way it is.” \nOn the Russian light heavyweights: \n“I have certain pressures in my career and in boxing most of those pressures come from what I have to accomplish for myself. The goals I have set are for myself. It really isn’t a competition or a comparison to other fighters from Russia or any other fighters in the division. As long as I am achieving what I have set out to do and as long as I am going beyond what I am supposed to be doing fight after fight, that is the achievement for me. That’s a win for me.” \nOn his opponent: \n“I never really try to set the main goal of knocking somebody out. Obviously, I want to showcase a good, exciting fight. I will be looking for openings and if there are openings I will use as many of them as I can. Hopefully, I can try to finish the fight earlier but I am ready to go the full ten rounds if I have to.” \nCedric Agnew (29-2, 17 KOs) – Former WBO Light Heavyweight World Championship Challenger \nOn his opponent: \n“I think he is a pretty tough competitor but that goes without saying because everyone is a tough competitor. My thing is to overcome what I am dealing with that night and to impose my will on him and come out with the victory. It is going to be an all-out war. I am just trying to take it to him the whole fight. The things they say about him [Bivol] are the same things they said about Kovalev. I didn’t run from Kovalev. I can take a hit. I just need to stand in there and try to overcome that storm for the first few rounds and stay focused, stay grounded and stay ready.” \nOn his title fight with Kovalev in 2014: READ Andre Ward vs. Sergey Kovalev 2 grand arrival Quotes \n“I just underestimated him. It was a learning experience. I grew from it. I am still trying to grow. Afterwards, we went back to the gym and we worked on different things and worked on perfecting different parts of my craft. We’re not quite where we need to be but things are moving in the right direction. People don’t know certain things that a fighter deals with on fight night and in training camp. He could be feeling physically ready but not mentally ready. We need to give fighters a chance to prove themselves and comeback after a loss. People look at fighters like they are not human but we are human too.” \nOn his confidence for this fight: \n“If I wasn’t confident I wouldn’t be taking this fight. My thing is to fight the best-of-the-best in my weight class, to prove to myself and prove to the naysayers out there. I have been the underdog in quite a few fights and it doesn’t bother me at all. My thing is, those who really know me know I am not an underdog. It is going to be an action fight. It is going to be a grit and grind war out there. I am here to showcase my talent, my skills and it is going to be an amazing fight. You’re gonna see me fight a hell of a fight. You’re gonna see a lot of Cedric Agnew come Saturday night.” \nLuis Arias, USBA Middleweight Champion (17-0, 8 KOs) \n“I should have been at this stage (in my career) already but timing is everything. For whatever reason, my timing is now. I’m a little late; I’m 27 and should be fighting for a world title by now. But give it another year and I’ll be fighting for a world title. I’m just going to make a statement. I’m going to get him [Magomedov] out of there and I’m just going to start calling out some names. \n“The middleweight [division] is definitely one of the top divisions in the game right now; I think it’s middleweight, welterweight and heavyweight that are the popular divisions in the game. I’m coming out at the perfect time. There’s a mega-fight coming in September in my weight class. The goal is to get the winner. \n“[Magomedov] has a good record. He has the best record that I’ve fought so far. I honestly don’t feel like he’ll be my toughest opponent. But like I said, we’ll have to wait and see. He’s coming off a loss; he got dominated by an opponent. He’s fighting an undefeated champion, who is very confident and strong. Had the best camp I ever had. We’ll just have to wait and see. If he’s willing to take it, I’m willing to dish it out for 10 rounds but it will be over before then. We’ll find out Saturday night.” \nArif Magomedov (18-1, 11 KOs) – Former NABO Middleweight Champion \nOn his only career loss: \n“It was a long time ago; it was more than one year ago. I know I did a big mistake, I know what it was and right now I am preparing completely different. We are going to see everything is going to work for me for sure. I know why I lost the fight before and I know where I made my mistake. That guy was not very good and I was fighting in even more better fighters. I know how I’m going to work to (give him a loss).” \nOn his opponent: \n“He’s a very good boxer; he never had a loss and I watched a lot of his fights. I saw the video on the internet about him and he’s very fast and a very tough guy. I think he is one of the best opponents I ever had. Anybody who saw my fights on the internet probably tell that I’m going all the time straight, I give a lot of power punches and I’m doing a lot of combinations all the time.” \nOn extra motivation coming to the United States as the underdog: \n“I got the goal to have performance here in the United States and I am reaching it step-by-step. I’m going to the big shows and I know that one day I’m going to be a champion. People in the United States love boxing more than in my country. People are very loud here and you can feel the fans are very (interested) in the boxing; they know who is good in boxing.” \nWard vs. Kovalev 2: “The Rematch,” a 12-round mega-fight for the WBO/IBF/WBA Light Heavyweight World Championships, is presented by Roc Nation Sports, Main Events, Andre Ward Promotions, Krusher Promotions and Corona Extra, sponsored by Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, Jetlux, Life10 Electrolyte, Zappos, D’USSÉ Cognac, ProSupps and Powered by Monster.

Alison Lebrun helps tie blue-and-white awareness ribbons along Springfield Pike near the family home of Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old University of Virginia undergraduate student who was imprisoned in North Korea in March 2016... By DAKE KANGAssociated Press \nWYOMING, Ohio (AP) - An American college student who was imprisoned in North Korea and returned to his home state of Ohio in a coma suffered a \"severe neurological injury,\" a hospital spokeswoman said Thursday. \nOtto Warmbier is in stable condition at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center with his mother by his side, hospital spokeswoman Kelly Martin said. Doctors planned an update later Thursday. \nHis father, Fred Warmbier, said he does not believe North Korea's explanation that the coma resulted from botulism and a sleeping pill. He said there was no reason for North Korea to keep his son's condition a secret and deny him top medical care. \nFred Warmbier called his son's return bittersweet. \n\"Relief that Otto is now home in arms of those who love him and anger that he was so brutally treated for so long,\" he said at a news conference at Wyoming High School, where Warmbier graduated in 2013 as class salutatorian and played soccer. \nFred Warmbier told told Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Wednesday that Otto was \"terrorized and brutalized\" during his 17-month detention and has been in a coma for more than a year. \n\"The day after he was sentenced, he went into a coma,\" the father said in an interview scheduled to air Thursday night. He said he and his wife, Cindy, only learned of their son's condition last week. \nThe 22-year-old University of Virginia student was medically evacuated from North Korea and arrived in Cincinnati late Tuesday. He was then taken by ambulance to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. \nResidents of the northern Cincinnati suburb tied blue-and-white ribbons, the school colors, to trees near the family's home. Joy at his release was mixed with concern over his condition. \nIn its first official comment since Warmbier was returned home, North Korea said it released him over humanitarian reasons. The state-run Korean Central News Agency on Thursday said he had been sentenced to hard labor but did not comment on his medical condition. \nFormer New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said there should be an investigation into what happened to Warmbier leading to this \"tragic situation.\" \nRichardson, a Democrat, credited the Department of State with securing Warmbier's return from North Korea without any preconditions but said a forceful response from the U.S. government would be required \"if it's determined that there was a cover-up and Otto's condition was not disclosed and he didn't get proper treatment.\" \nWarmbier was serving a 15-year prison term with hard labor in North Korea after he tearfully confessed that he tried to steal a propaganda banner while visiting the country. \nSuch detentions in the totalitarian nation have added to tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. Three Americans remain in custody. \nThe U.S. government accuses North Korea of using such detainees as political pawns. North Korea accuses Washington and South Korea of sending spies to overthrow its government. \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday that his department was continuing \"to have discussions\" with North Korea about the release of the other three imprisoned American citizens. \nWhen asked by Fox News what he would tell the families of those detained, Fred Warmbier said, \"I wouldn't know what to say to them. This is, I've been told, not precedented.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Dan Sewell in Cincinnati contributed to this report.  ",

      "text": "Pinterest \n\nA North Carolina man was severely burned Tuesday evening after falling into a hot spring at Yellowstone National Park, according to park officials. \nGervais Dylan Gatete, 22, of Raleigh, N.C., was near the Lower Geyser Basin just north of the Old Faithful area, when he was injured, according to a statement from Yellowstone National Park. Gatete, who is an employee at Xanterra Parks & Resorts, was with a group of people when he fell in. \nAccording to the statement, the group put Gatete in a car and tried to get him to a hospital. They were able to flag down a park ranger just before midnight, and the 22-year-old was given medical attention and ultimately flown to a hospital. \nPark officials said the incident highlights how dangerous it can be to get too close to hot springs. According to the statement, there is \"scalding water just below the surface,\" near many of the hydrothermal areas. \n“Yellowstone’s thermal features are dangerous,” said Superintendent Dan Wenk. “We continually stress that people must stay on trails and boardwalks in geyser basins, not only to protect resources, but for their own safety.” Man severely burned after falling into a hot spring in the Lower Geyser Basin off of Fountain Flat Drive: https://t.co/IMeefICUUl . pic.twitter.com/HQ9fBmi1oj — YellowstoneNPS (@YellowstoneNPS) June 14, 2017 \nPark officials aren't sure how Gatete fell into the hot spring and an investigation is under way. \nThis is the first thermal accident in 2017, according to the park. In 2016, an Oregon man died after falling into a boiling, acidic spring in Yellowstone National Park. He was reportedly trying to ‘hot pot,” or soak in one of the park’s thermal pools, according to a report on the accident. \nMore coverage: \nFollow Mary Bowerman on Twitter: @MaryBowerman \n",

(per capita). This chart shows the national rate for opioid prescriptions ; 2c x 4 1/4 inches; 96.3 mm x 107 mm; By CARLA K. JOHNSONAP Medical Writer \nMONROEVILLE, Pa. (AP) - Even doctors can be addicted to opioids, in a way: It's hard to stop prescribing them. \nMelissa Jones is on a mission to break doctors of their habit, and in the process try to turn the tide of the painkiller epidemic that has engulfed 2 million Americans. \nIt was in doctors' offices where the epidemic began, and it's in doctors' offices where it must be fought. So Jones is using some of the same tactics pharmaceutical sales forces used to push their potent pills into communities - this time, to get them out. \nShe drives 100 miles a day to visit doctors across western Pennsylvania's Allegheny and Westmoreland counties, where prescription painkillers and their illicit cousin, heroin, killed more than 600 people last year. Bearing a smile, educational pamphlets and sometimes sandwiches, she is working to help doctors stick to new national prescribing guidelines, give them tips on how to handle patients demanding pills and remind them that opioids aren't very good for chronic pain anyway. \n\"Most people trust their doctors,\" said Jones' boss, Cheryl Bartlett. \"But we haven't trained doctors about addiction, how to recognize it early and treat it in their practices. Why not help doctors better understand how to care for their patients?\" \nThe rate of opioid prescribing has started to edge down in recent years, but it remains 56 percent higher than it was 20 years ago, enough to provide nearly every adult in America with a bottle of pills. The number of overdose deaths is still climbing, from pills that have been prescribed and from the surge of even more powerful opioids like fentanyl on the black market, where many turn for cheaper drugs after becoming addicted. \nWhile narcotics can bring short-term pain relief and help patients with cancer and in end-of-life care, they're often misprescribed. \nIncreasingly, the fight to save lives has put doctors in the crosshairs: They often feel they have no good choices to treat pain, and not enough time with patients who are already dependent on opioids. \nPennsylvania is among about a dozen states where people like Jones try to flip the script on drug marketing and push doctors toward change. Despite mounting evidence about the dangers of opioids - and their limited benefits for chronic pain - far less is known about what works to change doctors' behavior. \n\"What's taking so long to reverse this thing?\" asked an exasperated Dr. Gary Franklin, a University of Washington researcher who, more than a decade ago, published a paper sounding the alarm about fatal overdoses in patients prescribed opioids. \nAcross the U.S., lawmakers are restricting how doctors handle millions of quick encounters with patients in pain. \nIn Pennsylvania, where the opioid death rate is above the national average and rising, doctors now face sanctions if they fail to check a state-run database to flag those getting narcotics from multiple doctors. Massachusetts bars doctors from prescribing more than a seven-day supply to first-time opioid patients. Washington state won't let doctors prescribe high doses without consulting a pain specialist. And an Illinois congressman wants all U.S. opioid prescribers to take classes every three years. \nJones uses a gentler approach. Her visits, funded by state lottery dollars, are voluntary and part of a program for low-income seniors run by the Boston-based nonprofit organization Alosa Health. Jones and her colleagues visit 2,600 Pennsylvania doctors a year to talk about opioids and other issues. \nIt used to be difficult for Dr. Dorothy Wilhelm, a geriatrics doctor in Monroeville outside of Pittsburgh, to get patients to agree to a urine screen to test for prescription medications and illicit drugs. Now, with new guidelines and pocket cards from Jones that help her explain the screens, patients don't fight her anymore. \nEvidence from New York City's public health department and the Veterans Health Administration suggests Jones and others like her can reduce opioid prescribing, adapting a tried-and-true tactic from the pharmaceutical industry called detailing. \nDrug companies send charismatic sales reps to visit doctors with free pens, lunches and pill samples, along with sometimes-skewed information. \nIn 2007, Purdue Pharma agreed to pay more than $600 million in fines for falsely informing its sales force that its opioid pill OxyContin had less potential for addiction and abuse than other painkillers. The marketing helped feed a 20-year trend of skyrocketing prescribing. \nJones, who has a nursing background, is fighting back with a charm offensive of science-backed facts. \n\"When I see her coming, I know I'm going to learn something and it's fair,\" said Dr. Rudy Antoncic, an internist in McKeesport. \nAntoncic said he doesn't have time to monitor patients for addiction, discuss overdose reversal drugs or follow other steps in new opioid-prescribing guidelines - so he refers patients to pain specialists instead. \n\"I'm forced to say, 'Go to the pain clinic. Let those guys figure it out,'\" he said. \nPain medicine emerged in the 1970s as a specialty. Many pain specialists prescribe responsibly, but others are notorious over-prescribers, handing out medicine to known addicts. Jones would rather see her doctors keep their patients and follow the guidelines. \nOver sandwiches at a large medical practice in Monroeville recently, Jones quizzed two doctors about what's slowing down change. Their answers boiled down to choices, time and money. \n\"The problem with treating pain is there are not a lot of options,\" said Dr. Richard Rosenthal. \"Tylenol can affect the liver. Anti-inflammatories can affect the heart, the liver, the kidneys. You're not supposed to use muscle relaxants\" with elderly patients. \nDr. Chaitali Sarkar said patients want pills for \"instant gratification\" and resist safer alternatives. \n\"We need more than 20 minutes to talk to patients,\" Sarkar told Jones. \"Everybody's stretched thin.\" \nJones reminds doctors that opioids' side effects - besides addiction and death - include constipation and, in men, low testosterone. \nMinimizing harm by getting off opioids can seem a dismal prospect to patients, unless a doctor offers other ways to cope with pain. \nWhat about tai chi, massage or acupuncture? Jones asked, pointing to research in the educational materials she gave the doctors. Those usually aren't covered by insurance so can be expensive for patients, Rosenthal said. Physical therapy might be covered, but co-pays add up. \nMany chronic pain patients with valid opioid prescriptions become addicted - the best guess is about 1 in 10, according to an analysis of 38 studies. \nFor patients dependent on opioids, Jones makes sure doctors know how to taper them gradually to a lower dose. A pocket card she gives them suggests starting off by cutting the dose by a quarter or a half each week, which prompts scoffs from most doctors. \nCutting a dose in half \"would not be well-received\" by patients, Rosenthal said. \nStart off slower, Jones nudged, reminding that using antihistamines or antidiarrheal drugs can help manage withdrawal symptoms. \nAnother big worry for doctors trying to limit opioids for patients: Some patients may seek pills from dealers on the street. \nIt's been more than a year since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the first national prescribing guidelines for opioids. The action was followed quickly by most state governors signing an unprecedented Compact to Fight Opioid Addiction. \nThe ultimate goal is fewer deaths, but it may take years. \nResearch suggests \"it takes somewhere between 13 to 17 years for a new guideline to get fully implemented,\" said University of Colorado researcher Robert Valuck, who coordinates his state's response to the opioid crisis. \nAmong laws aimed at doctors, one of the more promising requires them to check a prescription drug-monitoring database to weed out patients with multiple doctors, pharmacies and prescriptions. Most states now have these databases. Pennsylvania is among the few requiring doctors to check it every time they prescribe an opioid. \nOne study found states requiring such checks, combined with restrictions on pain clinics, reduced opioid prescribing by 8 percent and prescription opioid overdose death rates by 12 percent, without increasing heroin overdose deaths. \nDoctors tell Jones they love the new requirement because it keeps them from being fooled into feeding addiction. Some patients even say they don't want to be tracked, so will stop taking opioids. If doctors can change their behavior and patients can change their expectations, there may be hope. \n\"We can't wait 17 years,\" Valuck said. \"The cost to society is too great. We have to address this problem as aggressively as we can.\" \n___ \nFollow AP Medical Writer Carla K. Johnson on Twitter: @CarlaKJohnson  ",

By PAUL ELIAS and SUDHIN THANAWALAAssociated Press \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A United Parcel Service driver who opened fire during a meeting with co-workers had filed a grievance that he was working excessive overtime and appeared to specifically go after the three drivers he killed before fatally shooting himself. \nJimmy Lam, 38, filed the grievance in March complaining of too much overtime and requesting that the package delivery company relieve him of working extra hours going forward, Joseph Cilia, an official with a Teamsters Union local that represents UPS workers in San Francisco, told The Associated Press. \nDuring a Wednesday morning meeting, Lam walked up to driver Benson Louie and shot him. As his co-workers frantically fled the room, he shot Wayne Chan in the back, and then walked up to him and \"finished him.\" Mike Lefiti was fleeing from the building when Lam went out onto the street and shot him, Cilia said witnesses told him. \n\"It's senseless. I can't think of anything. Why him? Why them?\" Cilia asked. \"I can't put it together.\" \nOfficials late Wednesday confirmed San Francisco residents Louie, 50, and Chan, 56, and 46-year-old Lefiti, of Hercules, were killed in the shooting. \nTwo other UPS employees were wounded, but Cilia said both were released from the hospital. \nAmid a barrage of gunfire, some workers sought refuge on the roof of the four-story facility, while others ran outside and pounded on the windows of a public bus, witnesses said. \n\"They were screaming, 'Go! Go! Go!'\" said Jessica Franklin, 30, who was riding to work when the bus made a regular stop in front of the UPS facility. \"As they got on the bus, they were all ducking.\" \nAuto shop owner Robert Kim said he saw \"a mob of UPS drivers\" running down the street screaming \"Shooter! Shooter!\" \nThe shooting prompted a massive police response in one of the city's industrial neighborhoods, about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from downtown San Francisco, Assistant Police Chief Toney Chaplin told reporters. \nUPS spokesman Steve Gaut said the shooter was a company employee. A San Francisco Police Department official identified Lam, 38, and said he's from San Francisco but had no immediate details on his background. \nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. \nLefiti's cousin, Mack Toia, told KGO-TV ( http://abc7ne.ws/2sch61d ) he was at the UPS facility waiting to pick up Lefiti when shots rang out. He left his van and saw his cousin sprawled on concrete behind a gate, Toia said. \n\"The police officers were right on the scene just like that. I got to touch him, but I couldn't hug him,\" Toia said. \"They just pushed me away because they were trying to resuscitate him.\" \nCo-worker Isaiah Miggins said he saw Lefiti, known as \"Big Mike,\" as he arrived for work just before 9 a.m., a few minutes before the shooting started. \"He was a joyful man. Always happy,\" Miggins said. \nOn social media, heartbroken family members of Lefiti recalled him as a warm-spirited man devoted to his children and family. A photo on his Facebook page shows Lefiti in his brown UPS uniform holding a trophy. He also posted photos of his UPS truck and an award for 15 years of service to the company in 2015. \nChaplin said police have not determined a motive. \nA 30-year-old tech worker who lives across the street from the warehouse said he heard up to eight gunshots. \n\"They were all in rapid succession,\" said Raymond Deng. \"It was like tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat.\" \nDeng watched from his window in the Potrero Hill section of San Francisco as workers fled the building. He said another group of about 10 people gathered on the roof and held up their hands waving for help. \n\"I saw police officers go up from the ramp and then storm the buildings,\" he said. \"It's crazy.\" \nOfficers found two victims outside and others inside and pulled the wounded to safety as they confronted the gunman, who was armed with an \"assault pistol,\" Chaplin said. \n\"The suspect put the gun to his head and discharged the weapon,\" Chaplin said, adding that police did not fire any shots. Two guns were recovered at the scene, he said. \nThe shooting occurred the same day a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice in Virginia, wounding U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and several others. \n___ \nAP writers Janie Har, Jocelyn Gecker and Linda Wang in San Francisco and Mike Balsamo in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  ",

      "text": "Legislature Trump says Scalise ‘in some trouble’ as House gavels back in FBI Agents work in the parking lot of the YMCA next to the baseball field at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, Va., Thursday the day after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of La. was shot during during a congressional baseball practice. Jacquelyn Martin — The Associated Press By Erica Werner, The Associated Press Posted: # Comments In this file photo, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of La. speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington. Scalise was shot Wednesday at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Va., congressional officials say. J. Scott Applewhite — The Associated Press file \nWASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump said Thursday that wounded GOP Congressman Steve Scalise is “in some trouble” but “he’s going to be OK, we hope,” offering that assessment as a shaken U.S. House gaveled back into session a day after the shooting of Scalise and others at a baseball field. \n“It’s been much more difficult than people even thought at the time,” Trump said of the treatment of Scalise, the No. 3 GOP leader, who is in critical condition and underwent a third surgery at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center. Trump visited the Louisiana congressman at the hospital Wednesday night, and Vice President Mike Pence paid a visit Thursday morning. \n“Steve in his own way may have brought some unity to our long-divided country,” Trump added. “We’ve had a very, very divided country for many years. And I have a feeling that Steve has made a great sacrifice, but there could be some unity being brought to our country. Let’s hope so.” \nAs the House returned to business, lawmakers sought some semblance of normalcy even as they offered prayers for the wounded and echoed the president in pledges of unity. Two Capitol Police officers sustained relatively minor injuries, as did a congressional aide, and they have been released from hospitals. But a congressional aide-turned-lobbyist, Matt Mika, was shot multiple times and critically injured, and he remained hospitalized. \n“When tragedy strikes we are family,” said Rep. Nanette Barragan of California, who plays on the Democratic baseball team and invited all to attend the congressional charity baseball game Thursday night at Nationals Park. Scalise and the others had been at the GOP team’s baseball practice in nearby Alexandria, Virginia, when they were shot. \nScalise was fielding balls at second base when he was hit in the hip, and sustained grievous injuries as the bullet traveled through his pelvis and injured internal organs. In the immediate aftermath Wednesday the extent of his injuries was not widely known. \nThe shooter was identified as James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old home inspector from Illinois who had several minor run-ins with the law in recent years and belonged to a Facebook group called “Terminate the Republican Party.” Over social media he had lashed out at Trump and the GOP. \nCapitol Police officers in Scalise’s security detail returned fire, and Hodgkinson later died from his wounds. \nEarlier Thursday, Republican lawmakers met behind closed doors to share reflections and pray. They signed oversized cards for the wounded. Advertisement \nYet politics was never far off. \nSome Republican lawmakers blamed the shooting on vitriolic political rhetoric, particularly rising from the left in the era of Trump. \nSpeaking on the House floor, Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., issued a call to “replace the hateful rhetoric and resistance with respect.” \nRep. Steve King of Iowa said over Twitter, “The center of America is disappearing, and the violence is incited by the leading cultural voices of the Left.” \nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi lashed out angrily at such comments. \n“How dare they say such a thing? How dare they?” Pelosi exclaimed. She noted that she has received numerous threats herself over the years, and is currently the target of millions of dollars in negative ads in a House district in Georgia where a hard-fought special election will take place next week. \nPelosi noted that Trump resorted to violent language at times on the campaign trail, and she accused Republicans of “sanctimony” in seeking to place blame on the left. \nScalise, 51, the No. 3 House Republican leader, was first elected in 2008. The popular and gregarious lawmaker is known for his love of baseball and handed out commemorative bats when he secured the job of House whip several years ago. \nThe shooting occurred at a popular park and baseball complex across the Potomac River in Alexandria, where Republican lawmakers and others were gathered for a morning practice about 7 a.m. The annual GOP-Democrats baseball game, which raises money for charity, will go forward as planned Thursday evening and a big crowd is expected. \nHodgkinson had been in the Alexandria area since March, living out of his van, said local FBI Special Agent In Charge Tim Slater. \nThe man’s apparent Facebook page included strong criticism of Republicans and the Trump administration. But Slater said authorities were still working to determine a motive and had “no indication” Hodgkinson knew about the ball practice ahead of time. \nThe GOP lawmakers’ team was taking batting practice when gunshots rang out and chaos erupted. Scalise was hit, and crawled out of the infield, leaving a trail of blood, colleagues said. \nTexas Rep. Mike Conaway described what sounded like an explosion, then lawmakers scattering off the field as police roamed in search of the gunman and engaged him. \n“The guy’s down to a handgun, he dropped his rifle, they shoot him, I go over there, they put him in handcuffs,” Conaway said, adding that if the shooter had “gotten inside the fence, where a bunch of guys were holed up in the dugout, it would have been like shooting fish in a barrel.” \nRep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina said he had just left the practice and encountered the apparent gunman in the parking lot before the shooting. The man calmly asked which party’s lawmakers were practicing and Duncan told him they were the Republicans. \nWhile top lawmakers, including Scalise, have security details, others do not and they regularly appear in public without protection. Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was hit in the head and grievously injured while meeting with constituents at a supermarket parking lot in 2011. \nAssociated Press reporters Chad Day, Eric Tucker, Matt Barakat, Meghan Hoyer, Sarah Brumfield, Michael Biesecker, Mary Clare Jalonick, Ken Thomas, Vivian Salama, Stephen Ohlemacher, Alan Fram and Andrew Taylor in Washington and Alexandria, and Ed White in Detroit contributed to this report.",

      "text": "GOLF June 15, 2017 3:11pm EDT June 15, 2017 3:11pm EDT European Tour, PGA Tour, Golf, News, English, U.S. Open, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth, Hideki Matsuyama There were plenty of players in red figures on the first morning of the U.S. Open, with Rickie Fowler enjoying a particularly strong start. Rickie Fowler in action at Erin Hills (Getty Images) Christopher Devine \nUpdated at 3:11 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 3:11 p.m. ET \nRickie Fowler was the first big name to make a significant move as birdies flowed for many of the early starters on Day 1 of the U.S. Open at Erin Hills. \nIn the lead-up to the year's second major, much had been made of the daunting challenge posed by the lengthy Wisconsin venue hosting the major tournament for the first time. \nHowever, Fowler birdied three of his first five holes after starting on the 10th, and there were plenty of other players making early progress. \nFowler — who tied for second in the 2014 U.S. Open — was soon joined at 3 under by Brian Harman, and Kim Meen-whee, Charley Hoffman and Brooks Koepka were among several players one shot off the lead. \nPlaying alongside Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama holed his approach to the par-4 15th for an eagle to move from plus-1 into red figures in a single swing. Throw it in long and let it spin back. Hideki Matsuyama with the touch from the fairway on the par-4 15th. #USOpen https://t.co/RPZIf0MNV6 — U.S. Open (USGA) (@usopengolf) June 15, 2017 \nYet the third member of that high-profile group, Jon Rahm, made a woeful start, bogeying the 10th, 11th and 14th to dampen the high expectations that had surrounded him coming into the event. \nJordan Spieth began solidly in the company of 2016 winner Dustin Johnson and another former champion, Martin Kaymer. Spieth was 1 under after draining a birdie putt from around 20 feet on the 11th. \nEarlier, Phil Mickelson's withdrawal from the tournament due to the event conflicting with his daughter's graduation was confirmed. \nRory McIlroy, Masters champion Sergio Garcia and Jason Day were among the later starters Thursday.",

      "text": "Scared of losing to David Muir? NBC accused of sneaky ratings move Updated on June 15, 2017 at 10:56 AM Posted on June 15, 2017 at 10:37 AM Syracuse native David Muir, left, anchors \"World News Tonight\" on ABC. Lester Holt anchors \"NBC Nightly News.\" Syracuse native David Muir, left, anchors \"World News Tonight\" on ABC. Lester Holt anchors \"NBC Nightly News.\"( ABC; AP By Geoff Herbert \nIs NBC scared of losing to Syracuse native David Muir ? \nABC is accusing the peacock network of making sneaky moves in its ratings battle for evening news. Muir's \"World News Tonight\" is winning total viewership for the season-to-date for the first time in 21 years, and could beat \"NBC Nightly News\" for the entire season for the first time since Peter Jennings sat in the ABC anchor chair during the 1995-96 season. \nNielsen ratings show \"World News Tonight\" ranks No. 1 in total viewers with an average of 8.447 million viewers, just 12,000 more than NBC's 8.435 million. \"CBS Evening News,\" which recently removed anchor Scott Pelley due to low ratings, has been stuck in a distant third place with an average close to 6 million. \nHowever, ABC would be ahead by even more if NBC wasn't gaming the ratings system with a method called \"retitling.\" Last week, NBC changed the name of its Lester Holt-anchored newscast to \"NBC-Nitely-News\" in the Nielsen books, though the show was still called \"Nightly News\" on air. \nAccording to The Wrap , retitling news programs is a \"clever, but generally accepted trick that networks sometimes play\" to keep overall ratings up on nights they expect lower-than-usual viewership. So when ABC, NBC or CBS are competing with sports playoffs or awards shows, they tend to retitle telecasts to exclude those nights because they may be pre-empted on the west coast and never air in some markets. \nABC, for example, retitled two of Muir's shows last week to \"Wrld News Tonite\" because they were on the same nights as NBA Finals games. NBC did the same on two nights that week due to the NHL Stanley Cup Finals, but ended up retitling the entire week -- irking the alphabet network. \n\"The Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday telecasts were retitled despite airing at full coverage levels (93%),\" ABC said in a press release. \"NBC chose to not include their ratings for one of the biggest news weeks of the year, which included former FBI Director James Comey releasing his prepared remarks and details from his memos to Congress and the American people.\" \nMuir averaged 7.9 million viewers last week, while Holt averaged 7.2 million -- but because of retitling, NBC's season average is still close to ABC. \n\"Due to sports, all three evening newscasts would have been rated on the same day only once last week: Tuesday evening,\" an NBC News spokesperson told TheWrap, defending the move. \"One head-to-head night does not accurately reflect an entire week of ratings, so 'Nightly News' was retitled for the full week.\" \nThe Wrap points out that no network has retitled an evening news program for an entire week since Nielsen records began in 1991. \nNBC is still leading in the key news demographic of viewers ages 25-54, though, with 1.680 million viewers last week compared to 1.647 million for ABC. \"Nightly News\" also won 96 of 97 weeks in the demo, losing only in June of last year during the same week that NHL Finals and NBA Finals overlapped. \n\"NBC Nightly News,\" previously hosted by Brian Williams, had dominated the TV ratings battle for more than a decade. According to Nielsen Media Research, Williams led Diane Sawyer by more than 1 million total viewers each night in the 2013-14 season, but Muir started making gains when he took over \"World News Tonight\" in 2014 and brought the total viewership margin down to just 370,000 in his first year as anchor. \nMuir, a former reporter at CNY Central's WTVH and a graduate of Onondaga Central High School and Ithaca College, has long credited his Central New York upbringing with his success. \n\"I'm still driven by those voices every single night in putting together this national broadcast,\" he told syracuse.com . \"I think the sensibilities of having grown up in Upstate New York and the concerns, the fears, the hopes of the people there are reflected all over the country. And that still drives me to this day.\" 16 Gallery: David Muir, Syracuse native and ABC News anchor",

      "text": "Couple who met at a camp for kids with cancer marry many years later BY ABC News Radio | June 15, 2017 Courtesy Caylee Renick \n(NEW YORK) — When any couple gets married, there’s a certain element of unknown about the future. \nFor Caylee and Joey Renick, that uncertainty is magnified. The 23-year-olds met when they were 10 at a camp for kids with cancer and their siblings called Camp His Kids. \nJoey, who was diagnosed at 3 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), is in remission from ALL and is currently recovering from a bone marrow transplant. \nCaylee’s sister, Taylor, also had cancer. \n“If we let Joey being sick get in the way of getting married I wouldn’t have the life I have now,” Caylee told ABC News. \nIt’s been a long road from their days as campers to their wedding on a Florida beach one month ago. In that time, the couple has repeatedly faced down adversity. Joey’s cancer has returned twice. The couple had to cancel their initial wedding plans and Joey has had to put his career plans to become a nurse on hold. Taylor died in 2008 when she was 16 years old. \nBut on May 14 in Seacrest, Florida, the couple wed before their families and closest friends — including their 4-year-old nephew Thomas, himself recently diagnosed with ALL. Caylee said she knew Taylor, “was watching” as the families gathered for the beach ceremony. \nOver the years the couple maintained a friendship and texted often. It was when Joey’s cancer came back just before his 18th birthday in 2011 that the relationship reached another level. \n“I couldn’t drive, so Caylee came to pick me up. We went for ice cream and then Starbucks. We stayed there for hours talking until they closed the store,” Joey Renick said. \n“I was sitting there saying things I’ve never said out loud, how I felt about my sister passing away,” said Caylee Renick. “I knew I wanted a relationship with him.” \nThat first year, when Joey was at his sickest, was hard for them both. \n“Joey was being treated at the same hospital my sister was treated at and many of the doctors and nurses were the same,” she said. “It brought back a lot of memories of the time Taylor was sick.” \nThey spent the majority of the first year of their courtship in the hospital. \n“When we started dating she was phenomenal and I liked her so much,” Joey said. “I did not want my baggage to be put on her, but it made me realize she could handle this and she was there for me.” \nThe couple got engaged and a few months later, Joey was diagnosed again. They had to cancel the wedding they had planned. \nWhile Joey was sick, a woman named Gail Marchbanks from an organization called Kellsie’s Hope asked Joey what he wanted. “I want to marry Caylee,” he said. \nAnd so the planning began for the wedding in Florida — a special place to Caylee’s family. It was the last place they vacationed as a family before Taylor died. \nNicole Richardson of Sandprints Photography was there to capture the event. \n“Working with Caylee & Joey was incredible,” she told ABC News. “All wedding days are important but I knew I needed to make certain that I captured memories for the entire family. Group photos were just as important as the bride and groom images. I feel blessed to have been just a small part of their incredible journey.” \nIt was picturing the big day that got the couple through Joey’s relapse and bone marrow transplant. \n“I saw Caylee and she was more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. It was in that moment, on the beach with our family and closest friends that it all hit me. Just one year ago, I didn’t know if I would make it. And now I was marrying this woman who had literally been with me through the best and worst times of my life,” he said. \nThe couple hopes to someday start a family. Joey is currently in remission and recovering from his bone marrow transplant well. He hopes to resume his plans for a nursing career in the fall. \n“I hope he can use our story to give others hope,” Caylee said. “Out of hard times, good things can come.” \nCopyright © 2017, ABC Radio.

      "text": "Klay Thompson invites the toaster guy to pop up at the Warriors' title parade The Warriors went 31-2 after a fan asked Klay Thompson to autograph his toaster 3m ago • 1 min read \nThe Golden State Warriors ' romped through the playoffs, going 16-1 after defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-1 in the NBA Finals. \nAnd right before the Warriors' playoff run, they had a similarly impressive stretch, winning 15 of their last 16 games in the regular season to finish a league-best 67-15. \nIt's easy to find what sparked the Warriors' late-season surge. \nSure, having Kevin Durant and Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and Draymond Green definitely didn't hurt the Warriors, but they owe their success to a toaster. No, seriously. Back on March 14, a Golden State fan brought his toaster to an autograph signing by Thompson and had the guard ink his signature on the toast making machine. Klay's reaction to a fan asking him to sign his toaster is priceless. 😂 (via @R_Dollaz ) pic.twitter.com/y29GCVfG8c — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) March 14, 2017 \nThompson was quite confused, but later that night, the Warriors beat the Philadelphia 76ers , kicking off a remarkable 31-2 run that culminated in their championship-clinching Game 5 victory on Monday night in Oakland. \nAs proof of the role the toaster played in the Warriors' success, the guy who brought the toaster will be at the parade Thursday morning when the Warriors roll through the streets to celebrate their second title in three seasons. Still can't believe it. @KlayThompson legit invited me to the parade last night. All because of a toaster. #DubNation — Ronnie • GSWToaster (@R_Dollaz) June 13, 2017 \nNo word if the toaster will be there too, but I really hope it gets brought along. In fact, while they're at it, someone should get this toaster a championship ring.",

MARSHA HALPER Miami Herald File As summer activities bring scrapes, cuts and burns, Phillips Company is recalling nine brands of topical antibiotic products after an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities. MARSHA HALPER Miami Herald File June 15, 2017 9:41 AM Don’t use these recalled topical antibiotics when you need first aid \nBy David J. Neal Order Reprint of this Story \nAs summer activities bring scrapes, cuts and burns, Phillips Company is recalling nine brands of topical antibiotic products after an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities. \nThe brands being recalled are Tetrastem, Diabecline, Tetracycline-ABC, VenomX, Acneen, StaphWash, StringMed, NoPain and LidoMed. All the products are sold nationwide in 5 ml dropper bottles. Most are used to prevent infection from those skin-breaking moments common to kids, especially during summer. \nThe recall notice from Phillips on the U.S. Food & Drug Administration site states, “The products are being recalled after an FDA inspection found significant manufacturing practices that calls into question the safety, identity, strength, quality and purity of unexpired drug products made at the firm during the past three years.” \nConsumers with questions can e-mail Phillips at hp@valliant.net or call 580-746-2430, Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Anyone experiencing a bad reaction should contact their doctor, then the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program either online or by calling 800-332-1088 and requesting a reporting form.

He also said the U.S. wants to secure its borders to \"bolster U.S. national security\" as part of the agenda of President Donald Trump. \nHe says the goal of the U.S. in the region is to \"create the prosperity we all want.\" He said that must include ways to reduce the number of people working in the informal sector and make it easier for people to start new business in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. \nTillerson says, \"What happens in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala directly affects the security and economic interests of the United States and other countries in the region,\" he said. \nHe spoke at the opening session of the Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is meeting with leaders of Central America and senior officials from Mexico as President Donald Trump signals a policy shift toward the region. \nTillerson is taking part in discussions in Miami aimed at improving the economies of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.

      "text": "Ben Davies 15 Jun 2017 \nManchester City's Raheem sterling has discussed how his side will improve next season - claiming that they will become more 'streetwise'. \nCity's first season under Pep Guardiola got off to a blistering start, but the momentum soon faltered, and in the end the Citizens had to settle with finishing the season in third place without winning any trophies. Speaking on the matter, England and City winger Raheem Sterling talked about how their campaign wasn't good enough. ​ club's official website . \n“We had started really well and made some good strides but we didn’t finish by doing what we wanted to do. We can take a lot of positives out of the season and take them into next year.\" \nSterling also spoke of how he expected his side to be better next term, claiming that they will be 'more streetwise' throughout. With the team, the players and the manager we have, it’s looking to be good in the future. We’re a team that can punish teams. We need to defend better as a unit – not letting in as many cheap goals. That’s what has cost us – our own mistakes and collective errors on the field. “Once we become more streetwise, we’ll be a real force.” On his own form, the former Liverpool man underplayed his role in the team. Guardiola seemed to bring the best out of a player often scrutinised in previous years, and Sterling arguably had one of his best ever seasons in professional football. “I did alright last season.\" The modest winger said. “I did a few decent things and scored in a few games. I was one goal away from my best tally. “I need to keep pushing and keep getting goals.” \n​​ ",

Firefighters work at the scene after a deadly blaze at a high rise apartment block in London, Wednesday, June 14, 2017. Fire swept through a high-rise apartment building in west London early Wednesday, killing an unknown numb... By DANICA KIRKAAssociated Press \nLONDON (AP) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered a full public inquiry into the high-rise apartment blaze that killed at least 17 people in London amid growing public anxiety about whether similar blazes could occur in other housing blocks around the country. \nMay moved quickly to establish exactly what caused the fire - and why it moved so quickly, engulfing the building that housed as many as 600 people in less than an hour. \nFire safety engineers were stunned at the pace in which flames tore through the 120-apartment Grenfell Tower early Wednesday when most people were asleep. Senior fire officials described the progression of the fire as unprecedented. \n\"We need to know what happened,\" a resolute May said. \"We need to know an explanation. We owe that to the families, to the people who have lost loved ones and the homes in which they lived.\" \nLondon firefighters, many traumatized by the devastation, worked Thursday to make the building safe so they could continue searching for more victims. Entire families are still missing, and the death toll is certain to rise. The apartment tower is so huge there is still no exact count of the missing. \nIn addition, 74 people were injured in the blaze, with 37 hospitalized and 17 of them still in critical condition. \nFire Commissioner Dany Cotton said it would be a \"miracle\" if anyone else were to be found alive. \nIt is unsafe for firefighters to go into parts of the 24-story tower, so the fire department is working with structural engineers to shore up the building so they can complete a \"finger-tip search\" of the entire structure, Cotton said. Structures may need to be erected inside the torched building to make it safe enough to search. Cotton said specialist dogs would also be brought in to help the search. \nMore stories of residents' desperation during the catastrophe emerged. \nFirefighters trying to race into the building were protected from falling debris by police officers, who placed riot shields over their heads. One woman threw a baby out the window to escape the flames. Others tossed small children. Some adults jumped. Their fates were unclear at this time. \n\"I spoke to one of my officers, who was very near when someone came out the window, and he was in tears. And he is a professional fire officer,\" Cotton told Sky News. \"We like to think of ourselves as 'roughty, toughty' and heroes - they are heroes - but they have feelings. People were absolutely devastated by yesterday's events.\" \nMore than 200 firefighters worked through the night at the public housing block. Now that the heavy black smoke has cleared, the public could only gape at the huge burned-out hulk in west London's working-class, multi-ethnic North Kensington neighborhood. \nA tenants' group had complained for years about the risk of a fire in the building. The cause of the fire is under investigation, and authorities have refused to speculate on what could have started the blaze. But the focus has turned to renovations completed last year that added decorative touches to the building. \nThe renovation project included the installation of insulated exterior cladding, double-glazed windows and a communal heating system. Fire experts say the investigators will need to look at what materials were used and who approved their use. \nThe London Fire Brigade said it received the first reports of the blaze at 12:54 a.m. and the first engines arrived within six minutes. Survivors told of frantic attempts to escape. \n\"The flames, I have never seen anything like it. It just reminded me of 9/11,\" said Muna Ali, 45. \"The fire started on the upper floors. ... Oh my goodness, it spread so quickly. It had completely spread within half an hour.\" \nMore than 1 million pounds ($1.27 million) has been raised to help victims of the tragedy as volunteers and charities worked through the night to find shelter, food and clothes for people who had lost everything. \nSt. Clement's Notting Dale, a church near the tower, has turned into an informal center for people searching for friends and family. \nLaminated signs bearing missing peoples' phone numbers are tied to the fence next to notices from happier times advertising the Summer Fete with its barbecue, children's games and giant slide. A handwritten sign reads \"breakfast from 0800 inside.\" The church is also serving lunch and dinner to survivors. \nOn a utility box by the church's front door, residents have taped signs looking for information about Khadija Saye, last seen on the 20th floor, and Mariem Elggwahry, last seen on the 19th floor at 2:30 am. \nA massive white poster has been placed on a wall nearby and people offered messages of hope and condolence in many languages, including English, Arabic and Spanish. \n\"Praying for auntie,\" one message read. \nCommunity centers in London have been overwhelmed by the number of donations flooding in for those left homeless. So much food, clothing, shoes and other items have been coming in that the centers, churches and mosques have had to start turning away new donations. One heaving table at a local church came with a note: \"Help yourself.\" \nMissing people posters have been put up throughout North Kensington. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has offered free food for survivors at one of his nearby eateries. \nMany were moved to tears Wednesday at a moment of silence outside the Notting Hill Methodist Church in west London. \n\"There are times when all the words we can say are not adequate. And sometimes words fail us because no words can do justice to how we feel, or what we have seen or what has happened. Today is one of those days,\" Rev. Mike Long said. \n\"What we can simply do is look to all that we have seen today - which is good, which is fabulous - people getting together.\" \nNone of the 17 victims have been identified so far. \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Frank Griffiths contributed to this report.

On Thursday, June 15, 2017, Freddie Mac reports on the we... By PAUL WISEMANAP Economics Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Long-term U.S. mortgage rates edged up this week as the benchmark 30-year rate bounced back from a seven-month low. \nMortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose to 3.91 this week from 3.89 percent last week. The rate stood at 3.54 percent a year ago and averaged a record low 3.65 percent in 2016. \nThe rate on the 15-year mortgage rose to 3.18 percent from 3.16 percent. \nFreddie Mac chief economist Sean Becketti said this week's higher rates might not last. Freddie Mac surveyed mortgage lenders before the government reported Wednesday that U.S. consumer prices fell in May, causing a drop in the yield on 10-year Treasury notes, which often influences mortgage rates. \nTo calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount. \nThe average fees on 30-year and on 15-year mortgages were both unchanged at 0.5 point. \nRates adjustable five-year loans rose to 3.15 percent from 3.11 percent last week. The fee was unchanged at 0.5 point. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

      "text": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) — St. John Paul II discussed stepping down as pope with his aides but was advised against it in the interest of the Catholic Church , his former secretary said in a book recently published in the pope's native Poland.\nA book of interviews with the Polish Rev. Mieczyslaw Mokrzycki , \"Secretary of Two Popes,\" released last month, has offered some insight into the daily life at the Vatican with John Paul and his German-born successor, Benedict XVI.\nMokrzycki, now the Archbishop of Lviv, Ukraine, served as John Paul's secretary from 1996 until the pope's 2005 death. He then became secretary to Benedict from 2005 to 2008.\nWhile the book said that both pontiffs spent much of their days praying, it pointed out the contrast between gregarious John Paul, who would invite aides and friends to morning Masses and to debates at the table, and Benedict, who liked to \"eat in peace\" and spent his free time playing the piano.\nJohn Paul's musings about resignation had previously been revealed by his personal secretary, Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz . But Mokrzycki described the circumstances.\nLatest videos Mokrzycki said that the aging and ailing Polish pontiff would sometimes ask those gathered around the table during meals — his Secretary of State, Cardinal Angelo Sodano , and other cardinals and bishops — whether he should resign because of his old age and poor health.\n\"Everyone advised against it,\" Mokrzycki said. \"They were saying he is the Holy Father and that that means carrying out the mission to the end.\"\nThey argued that more people came to his Masses ever since they saw him performing his duties despite his evident suffering.\nBorn Karol Wojtyla in Wadowice, Poland, the popular pontiff died April 2, 2005, at the age of 84. Benedict declared him a saint in 2014.\nThe conclusion of the same dilemma was different for Benedict, born Josef Ratzinger , who unexpectedly stepped down in 2013, aged 83, citing his fading strength. He is now \"Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI \" and lives in the Vatican.\n\"He has excellent relations with Pope Francis and I don't think he feels lonely,\" Mokrzycki said. He said Benedict receives many visitors, including retired Vatican photographer Arturo Mari and former chamberlain Angelo Gugel.\nThose near him say that he \"sees more people now than during his pontificate,\" Mokrzycki added.\nIn the book, he detailed how both popes followed rigid daily schedules of meetings, signing documents, dictating speeches and praying.\nJohn Paul expected Mokrzycki to sing prayers with him as he was shaving the pontiff, but the secretary found it too much of a challenge to do both simultaneously and suggested playing the prayers from a recorder.\n\"The Holy Father looked at me and I knew it was not a good idea,\" Mokrzycki said. \"I heard a brief 'No' and the pope shut his eyes and continued to pray.\"\nAs for Benedict, he \"spent hours on his knees, praying\" for people who had asked for his prayers, chiefly for their health.\nJohn Paul liked scrambled eggs on bacon for breakfast, served in a small frying pan. He also liked traditional Polish potato pancakes and a piece of cake for dessert. On Sundays, he was served Polish traditional \"schabowy\"— pork chop fried in eggs and bread crumbs. For visitors, it was chiefly Italian cuisine.\nBoth popes watched Italian TV news in the evening, and John Paul had no radio.\nBenedict spent his free time playing the piano, reading, listening to classical music — \"he loved Mozart\" — and watching big soccer matches.\nHe loves cats and would spot stray ones during his walks, Mokrzycki said.",

      "text": "Otto Warmbier's father: 'North Korea is a pariah regime... terrorists' Jessica Noll, WXIA 11:26 AM. EDT June 15, 2017 Otto Warmbier of Cincinnati was in North Korea with a tour group when officials there detained him. (Photo: Submitted to USA TODAY) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nCINCINNATI – Wearing the beige suit jacket his son, Otto, wore in a North Korean court while reading his confession, Fred Warmbier said, with tears in his eyes, that his family is “thrilled that our son is on American soil.” \nOtto, a 22-year-old college student was imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year, is in a coma, and was transported to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center in Cincinnati, Ohio Tuesday night. \n“Otto has left North Korea. He is on Medivac flight on his way home,\" Fred and Cindy Warmbier said in a statement earlier this week. “Sadly, he is in a coma and we have been told he has been in that condition since March of 2016. We learned of this only one week ago.” \nWhen his family found out about his condition, his father said they were in “disbelief.” \n“[I] couldn’t sit down,” Fred recalled. \nMORE | Otto Warmbier's parents: Our son has 'been brutalized' by North Korea \nBut on Thursday, he spoke out for his son who cannot talk about what happened to him. \n“We want the world to know how we and our son have been brutalized and terrorized by the pariah regime in North Korea. We are so grateful that he will finally be with people who love him.\" \nWhile his mother, Cindy remained by her son’s hospital bed, Fred spoke Thursday morning at a press conference at his son’s alma mater, Wyoming High School, in Wyoming, Ohio, about his son’s condition and what he thought about the country that held his son captive for 18 months without allowing any contact with his family. \nHis father shared that his family has bittersweet feelings; one of relief that he’s home and another of anger that he was “so brutally treated for so long.” \nBut, he said, Otto is a fighter and “survived through the worst that North Korea put him through… North Korea has proven that they are not nature’s noblemen,” Fred said. \nWhen Otto arrived home to Cincinnati Tuesday, Fred said he knelt by his son and told him that he was glad that he made it home. \n“I am so tremendously proud of Otto. His spirit is with us,” his father said, continuing that his family is “rock-solid, happy and positive.” \nA representative from UC Health confirmed at the press conference, that Otto was in stable condition, however, that he does have a “severe neurological condition.” \nFormer United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson, who efforted Otto’s release, said North Korea’s healthcare is “primitive,” and the circumstances surrounding Otto’s condition are unclear. \n“This is a matter of grave concern,” he said. “How did he fall into a coma? And why was this not disclosed?” \nThere is no reason, Fred said, why any civilization should keep a person’s condition a secret or deny him medical care, as he said North Korea did to his son. \n“We have few answers—there’s no excuse for how North Korea has treated our son,” Fred said. “What he endured, the brutality, the terror that he went through… that doesn’t speak to who Otto really is… He’s a sweet, loving, kind person,” citing that he’s never been in trouble in his life. \nSens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, applauded Otto's release even as they expressed concern about the situation Otto and his family have been through. \n\"The Secretary of State has confirmed to me that Otto has been released by North Korea, and is being returned to his family,” Portman said in a statement. “Fred, Cindy and the Warmbier family have been remarkably strong throughout this ordeal. Over the last 18 months, they have had to endure more than any family should have to bear.” \n\"We have been extremely concerned about his situation all along as we are about any American who has been detained in North Korea or anywhere in the world,\" Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said. \"We strongly suggest that Americans do not go to North Korea.\" \n“North Koreans lure Americans… [as] a ‘safe place to go,” Fred said about his son, a University of Virginia student, who was with a tour group. \nHe was detained as tour group prepared to leave North Korea, and was charged with engaging in “anti-state activity.” \nHe was subsequently sentenced in March 2016 after a televised trial in North Korea, when he publicly confessed to stealing a propaganda banner. \n“North Korea is a pariah regime,” Fred said about the country who deemed his son as a “war criminal.” \nContributing: USA TODAY reporters Deirdre Shesgreen, Oren Durell and the Associated Press. \n© 2017 WXIA-TV ",

People don’t believe it, but I’m going to show you.” \nFor some reason I believe him. He will show everyone how much better he is and then one sprint later he will fall apart again. Can’t believe they’re giving him another shot but then again this is Snyder’s team we are talking about and he loves to collect crap players.

That’s the coaches fault? remstar10 says: Jun 15, 2017 11:00 AM \nSunday October 15th, Browns Texans. I don’t care if Kizer/Kessler pro bowl level at that point, Brock needs to start that game! Lisa_the_Greek says: Jun 15, 2017 11:00 AM \nI must admit, this seems like it might be true… the Texans are not exactly known for success at the QB position. donbat67 says: Jun 15, 2017 11:00 AM \nDidn’t think he was bright enough to make to make a veiled comment like this . Jun 15, 2017 11:02 AM \nUNCOACHABLE \nIf you get tossed out as uncoachable, you’re done. chc4 says: Jun 15, 2017 11:04 AM \nSo lame. This guy is a clown. Take responsibility for your poor play. I seriously doubt he will get any better with all the “great coaching” in Cleveland. Or anywhere else for that matter. tjacks7 says: Jun 15, 2017 11:04 AM \nThis guy has been in the NFL for 5 years and he hasn’t mastered the fundementals such as having the correct footwork or the ability to throw the ball accurately? \nAnd I’m no QB guru, but I fail to see the link between proper footwork and making good decisions. Does having the proper footwork somehow make you more intelligent and able to read defenses better? crenshawpete714 says: Jun 15, 2017 11:05 AM \nWow, between pouting when he got benched in Denver for playing poorly, leaving them out of spite, and now bashing the Texans as if they’re to blame for his issues, it’s safe to say this guy sucks. RegisHawk says: Jun 15, 2017 11:05 AM \nSo he had them, he lost them, and now he’s getting them back…doesn’t sound all that “fundamental” to me. factschecker says: Jun 15, 2017 11:08 AM \nBrock is the guy that made it clear to the Houston coaching staff during the 2016 offseason. “I’m not Tom Brady.” \nHe was the one not willing to arrive before the sun comes up and go home long after the sun had set. You only get out what you put in. If you put the minimum in then you will only get the minimum out of your work. \nYou are the sum of your preparation. -Tom Brady Jun 15, 2017 11:09 AM \nWe lol at trashweiler bigbenisabigbaby says: Jun 15, 2017 11:14 AM \nA “shot”? Not quite. You really need to get out the magnifying glass to come up with that. Nothing to see here except a slow day in the news. niners816 says: Jun 15, 2017 11:14 AM \nI don’t know why but Osweiler has always been very unlikable. Everything he says makes me like him less and less. grumpysal says: Jun 15, 2017 11:15 AM \nSo, it’s the coaches fault that you couldn’t keep your feet and arms properly aligned? Jesus, you’re supposed to be a Pro QB, but can’t monitor yourself enough to keep a job that you need a coach to drill it into you every day? bobsacamano2 says: Jun 15, 2017 11:17 AM \nI don’t see that as a shot at all. I see that as a guy who recognizes he has a flaw and is glad his coaches are helping him with it. \nIf it is a shot, it’s not a good one. Not sure how you can blame the coaching staff because of your own flaws. \nBut again, I don’t see that at all. Jun 15, 2017 11:19 AM \nThe reason the texans traded him was attitude. Not his play. patriots123456 says: Jun 15, 2017 11:21 AM \nThe mistake the Texans made was acquiring him and paying him what they did. \nBut they smartened up and dumped him… mongo3401 says: Jun 15, 2017 11:24 AM \nHe should be sending Houston bottle of Champagne weekly instead of taking shots at him. They made him a multi multi multi millionaire. Jun 15, 2017 11:24 AM \nIt’s easy to take shots at Brock Osweiler. He deserves a lot of them. \nBut EVERY QB cannot be wrong, or not up to par. At some point Bill O’Brien needs to be criticized, when QB play is supposed to be his forte. Jun 15, 2017 11:27 AM \nTakes a shot at the Texans…intercepted. The guy is not a leader. One day he thinks he is good enough the next its his coaches fault….hope he knows how to manage his money intrafinesse says: Jun 15, 2017 11:35 AM \nSo let me get this right: \n1) you market yourself as an NFL QB \n2) you get a starting job, getting paid starter wages \n3) you fail miserably \n4) its someone else’s fault \nCan I try that? Can someone help me get a job as a kicker, you don’t have to pay me much, just 2 years guaranteed at 500K per year. When I screw up I’ll blame… everyone but myself. \nHave fun in Cleveland Brock. paulniner79 says: Jun 15, 2017 11:35 AM \nI still can’t get over the fact that the Browns traded for him. The contract that Huston gave him was clearly a mistake, and Cleveland stepped in and assumed that liability. Even if you get a second rounder, this makes no sense. sopadegato says: Jun 15, 2017 11:44 AM \nIn Denver, Kubiak made him work. In Houston, O’Brien’s been through a dozen QBs and none of them worked. onereasonableman says: Jun 15, 2017 11:47 AM \nWhat ever happened to just shutting up and doing a good job. Start there. Let everyone else make their conclusions. billsbackto81 says: Jun 15, 2017 11:49 AM \nIn all fairness it’s not his fault that the Texans saw in him what the other QB needy teams didn’t. Which I guess would be a competent franchise QB. That was a hell of a contract for someone with such a small unproven body of work. What are you gonna say when someone throws you millions of dollars for what you know will end in failure? Uh……thank you. fireroger says: Jun 15, 2017 11:59 AM \nIn summary, a QBs coach failed to point out the problems with his mechanics. How likely is that considering that is their primary job? If true, that coach should be fired. But that seems highly unlikely. It’s more likely the coach couldn’t get through to him. patsfan4lifesbchamps says: Jun 15, 2017 11:59 AM \nCue the hurt feelings and delusional Texans fans. I wonder what will the Texans excuse be when they miss the playoffs this year? Will you still blame the QB and let O’Brien off the hook? He is the one wasting a championship roster. harrisonhits2 says: Jun 15, 2017 12:03 PM \nO’Brien is an excellent coach. Osweiller does not seem to be a hard worker. Seems clear to me where the problem is. streetyson says: Jun 15, 2017 12:06 PM \nFor all his faults, he did QB them into the playoffs and played his part (rated 90.1) in a postseason win over the Raiders – before getting dismantled by the Pats (but not many QBs survive a trip to Foxboro). And so he got treated a bit poorly, not least by O’Brien for not being Tom Brady – who O’Brien still thinks is a great QB because he got shouted at a lot by O’Brien despite the fact that Brady had 3 rings before O’Brien’s time and didn’t get numbers 4 and 5 until after O’Brien left. blackbug99 says: Jun 15, 2017 12:09 PM \nFor a guy who has never proved anything, he did get a nice chunk of change. cwmore1169 says: Jun 15, 2017 12:10 PM \nIf your QB is struggling to make accurate throws or bad decisions, I would think the HC or QB coach would review the film to determine if its the mechanics or a case of the brain farts unless the coach never like the QB in the first place and hoped he failed. Going back to the free agent signing where the coach never met with the prized free agent QB makes you wonder. Brock isn’t blameless but there’s no perfect player and they all need to be coached. whenwilliteverend says: Jun 15, 2017 12:11 PM \nShouldn’t a QB already have good fundamentals when he gets to the league? Did the Broncos have to coach him up hard on the fundamentals? Sounds like he’s just a whiner and using any excuse he can find to account for being benched last year for a nobody. denverscott says: Jun 15, 2017 12:19 PM \nWhew. Thanks to the commentators that showed us how this relates to NE. fanboyarmy says: Jun 15, 2017 12:27 PM \nRelax. Ozzy Baby is still in shock from getting beaten up by the chick that stole his pizza. Jun 15, 2017 12:28 PM \nPretty sure your mentor Manning never blamed his coaches for poor play on the field. 4512dawg4512 says: Jun 15, 2017 12:38 PM \nSet aside the immature haha jokes for a second, the guy made a great point. I’m liking him more and more weepingjebus says: Jun 15, 2017 12:39 PM \nHe learned this from Peyton. When in doubt, blame others. kmgpop says: Jun 15, 2017 12:43 PM \nShouldn’t the fundamentals be basically ingrained by the time you reach professional status??? You tool! I hope you wind up on the same scrap heap as JaMarcus Russell and Josh Freeman, among others. \nCertain players have had careers derailed by substandard coaching. You are not one of them! Grow up, or get out! xavier179 says: Jun 15, 2017 12:45 PM \nI call them as I see them. O’Brien is still riding the coat tails of his Penn State tenure. He has shown me nothing as a head coach. Houston will continue to be in the Super Bowl, as a host that is. harleywoman883 says: Jun 15, 2017 12:48 PM \nThe day I saw him throw a toddler tantrum when Peyton was put in the game to replace him was the day I knew he was toast… r502 says: Jun 15, 2017 12:53 PM \nEveryone likes to say Elway was smart to pass on paying this guy, which is true. \nHe also drafted this schmoe, and the other meh QB’s on Denver’s roster. Elway is not exactly turning out to be much of a talent evaluator when it comes to the QB position judging by who he has put on the field not named Manning. \nPretty sad considering he played the position at a hall of fame level… binarymath says: Jun 15, 2017 12:54 PM \ntjacks7 says: Jun 15, 2017 11:04 AM This guy has been in the NFL for 5 years and he hasn’t mastered the fundamentals such as having the correct footwork or the ability to throw the ball accurately? \nAnd I’m no QB guru, but I fail to see the link between proper footwork and making good decisions. Does having the proper footwork somehow make you more intelligent and able to read defenses better? \nI don’t think it’s footwork, but rather his balance. Perhaps if he were to stop wearing his derriere like a helmet… mlvcfan says: Jun 15, 2017 12:56 PM \nhe would be wise the keep quiet do his job and let his performance do the talking. dal1as says: Jun 15, 2017 12:57 PM \nI was happy when the Texans over paid for him to begin with being a Broncos fan. I just never felt like he was the “future” for the Broncos. He really does need a lot of coaching with his feet and arm motion. For being 6 feet 7 he gets more balls batted down at the line of scrimmage than anyone I have ever seen. Going to Cleveland may be the best thing form him. He is the best QB that they have right now. He should win the starting job. If not then he may be out of the league. rondayne says: Jun 15, 2017 1:02 PM \nBrock Osweiler is a complete clown, and the idea that he, an NFL QB, forgot the fundamentals of throwing a football because of a coach is absurd. \nThat being said, I don’t doubt for a second that O’Brien didn’t coach him on fundamentals. The idea that he is some QB guru is crazy, he just got lucky coaching Tom Brady. If I were a Texans fan I’d have serious doubts about his ability to develop a rookie QB. cmoney20 says: Jun 15, 2017 1:11 PM \nBrock should just change his name to Carson Wentz. That way, no one will criticize him no matter what. whywerule says: Jun 15, 2017 1:12 PM \nIf Osweiler was worried about his fundamentals, then why didn’t reach out to Tom House who has worked with other NFL QBs that wanted to brush up on their fundamentals? A list that includes Drew Brees, Tom Brady, Andy Dalton, Carson Palmer, Matt Ryan and others. I would argue that those QBs have all been more successful than Osweiler, yet still take the time to worry, and do something, about their fundamentals. joshgordonsbong says: Jun 15, 2017 1:12 PM \nSo what happens if Tom Savage comes out and is as good as B.O. says he’s been?? The ole excuse window will be slammed shut for good zoxitic says: Jun 15, 2017 1:12 PM \nBad blood with Denver, then bad blood with Houston. I’m no genius, but I bet on bad blood with Cleveland in the near future. damcmp says: Jun 15, 2017 1:13 PM \nO’Brien and he staff are a bunch of college coaches from primarily Georgia Tech that run the Wishbone. he came to Houston and was proclaimed a QB guru/whisperer.. there have 13 QBs out there since he arrived and discounting Savage he has not made one better,,,, ajames35 says: Jun 15, 2017 1:13 PM \nSo a questionable player on a bad team is taking shots at a team and coaching staff that’s been over .500 for several years? Got it. ajames35 says: Jun 15, 2017 1:17 PM \nPracticing fundamentals is always appropriate, but an NFL veteran should not need to be coached on proper fundamentals. \nNot to mention, good fundamentals do not mean much when paired with poor decision making… slash714 says: Jun 15, 2017 1:21 PM \nIt’s not like the Texans haven’t sucked since they’ve been in the league. Osweiler needa to quit whinning and be a man. It I think he has a chance to be good in a different environment. nathanp2013 says: Jun 15, 2017 1:25 PM \nIt’s your 6th year in the NFL Brock… they shouldn’t have to teach you fundamentals. nard100 says: Jun 15, 2017 1:29 PM \nYou have to believe Denver is laughing their heads off these days goodellhasabutthamster says: Jun 15, 2017 1:40 PM \nApparently he hasn’t heard that many established QBs find outside trainers to hone their technique in the offseason. bluenose1965 says: Jun 15, 2017 1:41 PM \npatsfan4lifesbchamps says: Jun 15, 2017 11:59 AM Cue the hurt feelings and delusional Texans fans. I wonder what will the Texans excuse be when they miss the playoffs this year? Will you still blame the QB and let O’Brien off the hook?

Jun 15, 2017 1:43 PM \nit’s my high school coaches fault I never made it to the pro’s. bluenose1965 says: Jun 15, 2017 1:46 PM \nr502 says: Jun 15, 2017 12:53 PM Everyone likes to say Elway was smart to pass on paying this guy, which is true. \nHe also drafted this schmoe, and the other meh QB’s on Denver’s roster.

Houston offered him more. Seems he thought almost as much of Brock as Rick Smith. kevpft says: Jun 15, 2017 1:52 PM \nWhen the Texans manage to get the most out of ANY QB in their entire history, THEN we can badmouth Osweiler. \nThat team is quickly outpacing the Browns as a place QBs’ careers go to die.

The Washington State Patrol is now looking for witnesses who saw the accident, which was determined to be a hit-and-run.\nTroopers and medics responded to the scene, in the southbound express lanes of I-5 near Seneca Street, at about 4:50 a.m. after receiving reports of a bad crash.\nA 2001 Chrysler Town and Country van was found on its side. The driver, a 60-year-old man, sustained a broken arm and other possible injuries. He was taken to Harborview Medical Center .\nA preliminary investigation found that the van was heading south on I-5 just south of the Convention Center when the driver made a lane change and struck the rear end of a semi-trailer that was also heading south. The van then struck the barrier and rolled onto its side. The semi rig continued on without stopping.\nThe State Patrol is now looking for any witnesses to the collision along with any identifying information for the semi truck. Anyone with information is urged to call the tip line at (425) 401-7741.",

      "text": "Jun 15, 2017 at 10:35a ET 0Shares \nFormer Kentucky guard De’Aaron Fox says he had plenty of motivation when playing UCLA and their star guard Lonzo Ball in the NCAA Tournament this season. \nThe Wildcats faced the Bruins twice during the 2016–17 campaign. \nIn their December matchup, UCLA snapped Kentucky’s 42–game win streak with a 97-92 win. Ball had 14 points, seven rebounds and six assists and Fox had 20 points in nine assists. \nWhen comes to Lonzo Ball’s outspoken father, LaVar, Fox says he had never heard of him until he start making outrageous claims about the ability of his son and his company Big Baller Brand. \n“In the last year, he became relevant for some reason,” Fox told SI.com's Andrew Sharp . “When I knew Lonzo in high school, I'd never seen his dad before. He went crazy this year. I guess when your son a lottery pick, that gives you a lot of confidence.” \nWhen the teams met again in the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet 16, Fox roasted Ball and UCLA for 39 points in the 86–75 Kentucky victory. \n“Kill mode all the time,” Fox says of his mindset before the UCLA game in the tournament. Fox had a different take his thought process months later. “Shut Lavar Ball up,” Fox said. \nThis article originally appeared on 0",

      "text": "Jun 15, 2017 at 11:15a ET 0Shares \nThe NCAA suspended University of Louisville basketball coach Rick Pitino for five Atlantic Coast Conference games and former staffer Andre McGee was hit with a 10-year show cause penalty after the NCAA said Pitino failed to monitor McGee, a former director of basketball operations at Louisville.. \nThe NCAA investigated the program after a woman alleged that a former Cardinals men’s basketball staffer hired strippers for sex parties with players and recruits and subsequently charged the school with four Level 1 violations including one against Pitino. \nThe penalties also include four years of probation for the university, men's basketball scholarship reductions and recruiting restrictions and a fine of $5,000. \nPitino was accused of not noticing red flags in the activities of Andre McGee, a former director of basketball operations at Louisville. \n“Pitino failed to demonstrate that he actively looked for red flags, asked pointed questions or even occasionally solicited honest feedback from McGee about activities occurring under his supervision,” the NCAA said in denying Pitino’s defense. \nThe probe started after Katina Powell said in her book “Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,” that McGee paid $10,000 for her and other dancers to perform for players at the team’s dormitory over a five-year period beginning in 2010. \nPitino denied having any knowledge of the activities described in Powell’s book with the school saying Pitino “fostered a culture” of compliance within NCAA rules. \nLouisville agreed with the NCAA in its response to the Notice of Allegations in January that impermissible benefits took place on 37 of 40 alleged instances. \nThe school’s own investigation into the allegations resulted in a self-imposed postseason ban after the 2015–2016 season, even though the team was ranked in the Top 20 for the majority of the season and would have likely received an NCAA tournament bid. \nThis article originally appeared on 0 ",

      "text": "LUXEMBOURG (AP) — Greece avoided another potential brush with bankruptcy after striking a deal Thursday with European creditors to tide it over for the rest of the year and gained assurances that its repayment burden will be eased when it finally can stand on its own after nearly a decade on financial life support.\nAfter months of haggling that raised fears of another escalation in Greece's near 8-year debt crisis, the 19-country eurozone cleared the release of a further 8.5 billion euros ($9.5 billion) after the Greek government delivered on an array of reforms. Getting the money was becoming increasingly urgent as Greece has a big repayment hump next month.\nPerhaps more importantly for the longer-term, the so-called Eurogroup made clear that it is ready to ease the burden of Greece's debt repayments at the conclusion of the current bailout program next year. The International Monetary Fund may also get involved financially, on a limited basis of up to $2 billion.\n\"Overall, I think this is a major step forward,\" said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the eurozone's top official. \"We are now going into the last year of the financial support program for Greece; we will prepare an exit strategy going forward to enable Greece to stand on its own feet again over the course of next year.\"\nHe singled out the Greek people for their \"intense efforts and resolve\" over the past few years of the country's bailout era when successive governments had to enact drastic spending cuts and tax increases in return for the money needed to avoid bankruptcy and a possible exit from the euro currency.\nThe left-led Greek government, which has lost a lot of support since signing up for the country's third bailout even after campaigning against austerity, hopes Thursday's deal will help it get to a position to tap the international bond markets that lost faith in 2010 and forced Greece to rely on rescue money.\nLatest videos \"We feel that after this Eurogroup (agreement) there is a much greater clarity for both the Greek people and for financial markets,\" Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said.\nThere is now \"light at the end of the tunnel,\" he said.\nThe office of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said in a statement that the decision sends markets a positive message.\n\"The main point of today's decision is that — for the first time — there is a clear Eurogroup commitment to support Greece's market access and the successful completion of the program, with the creation of a significant liquidity reserve to back the country's market access,\" it said.\nAmong the measures offered to Greece was a possible 15-year extension in debt and interest payments due European creditors. Also, following a recommendation from the new French government of President Emmanuel Macron , the possibility was raised of linking Greek repayments to growth, which could mean debt repayments being postponed in the event of an adverse shock.\nIn return for these assurance, Greece's government will have to continue with strict budgetary discipline beyond the end of its bailout program, including running a budget surplus after debt and interest payments of 3.5 percent of GDP through 2022 and then around 2 percent until 2060.\nWhile conceding that Greece didn't get everything it wanted, Tsakalotos said the country could now turn the page on its bailout era.\n\"We recognize that we did not want the perfect to be the enemy of the good,\" he said. \"And we also recognize that all sides have tried to give and compromise to some extent.\"\nUnder the terms of its 2015 bailout, Greece's European creditors had promised to provide cash and find a way to lighten the country's long-term debt load — as long as the government kept a lid on spending and deeply reformed the Greek economy.\nDespite years of austerity since Greece was first bailed out in 2010, the country's debt burden still stands at about 320 billion euros, or around 180 percent of Greece's annual gross domestic product. That's largely because the Greek economy has contracted around 25 percent, meaning a worsening in the debt load even as the government's budget improved markedly.\nAn outright cut in Greece's debt is not allowed under euro rules, but the length of time the country has in paying back its debts can be extended, and the interest rates on those debts can be cut.\nFor Greece, Thursday's agreement should limit the amount it has to pay out in debt servicing each year, freeing up money it can use to help the Greek economy and society. More comprehensive details should emerge in the coming months.\nOne of the reasons why Greece's bailout program stalled over the past few months was a disagreement on debt relief between the eurozone and the IMF, which contributed financially to Greece's first two bailouts but not the third. Before deciding whether to participate in the latest deal, the IMF has wanted more information about what debt relief Greece may get, to see if the debt burden will be sustainable in the long run.\nThursday's compromise shows the disagreement has yet to be fully bridged.\nHowever, Christine Lagarde , the IMF's managing director, said enough progress was made at Thursday's meeting for her to go to the IMF executive board in Washington to get the stand-by facility of less than $2 billion.\n\"I think there is a very strong focus on growth and that's a strong change of attitude and tone,\" she said.\nFor austerity-weary Greeks, the latest deal is unlikely to mean much change any time soon.\nOn Thursday, more than 2,000 older Greeks marched through Athens to demonstrate against cuts to monthly pensions.\n\"We can't live on 300 euros!\" they chanted, with some waving sticks.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Ioanna Spanou in Athens contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Twitter Getty Images If you bet on Phil Mickelson not playing in this year's U.S. Open , congrats. The five-time major champ ended weeks of speculation Thursday morning by officially withdrawing from this year's national championship at Erin Hills. Mickelson stayed home this week to attend the high school graduation of his daughter Amanda . But up until Thursday, he had held out hope for a weather delay that would have allowed him to make his 2:20 first-round tee time with Steve Sticker and Stewart Cink. Instead, alternate Roberto Diaz, will play in his place. This will be the first time since 1994 that Mickelson hasn't played in the U.S. Open, while Diaz, 30, will get his first start in the event. SPECIAL SUBSCRIPTION OFFER FROM GOLF DIGEST Fortunately for the rest of the field, the weather cooperated and the event got off without any delays on Thursday morning. The sunny skies put an end to Lefty's streak of playing in the event 23 years in a row, and made the trip Mickelson's caddie, Jim \"Bones\" Mackay, made to Erin Hills all for naught. Mickelson's pursuit of completing the career Grand Slam will have to wait until next year, when the U.S. Open returns to Shinnecock HIlls. Mickelson, who will turn 47 on Friday, finished T-2 to Retief Goosen the last time the tournament was held at the Long Island, N.Y., track in 2004. It's one of Mickelson's record six runner-ups in the event.",

      "text": "Twitter Hideki Matsuyama was off to a slow start at the U.S. Open -- until he provided the early highlight of the first round on Thursday at Erin Hills. The 28-year-old had bogeyed the par-5 14th hole after his fourth shot, a pitch, ran over the green and into a greenside bunker. But he righted the ship in the sportiest way possible. Here's video of how he did it: \nhttps://twitter.com/usopengolf/status/875359997252714496 We love watching Matsuyama's sweet swing. And it's even sweeter when he's providing highlights like that. You can't hit a more perfect shot than that -- and it came at the right time for Matsuyama, to find red numbers when things weren't going great.",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nIn recent years, the world has seen a surge in migrants fleeing war, political persecution, or economic chaos. According to the United Nations, most of these displaced persons remain in their own countries, but millions also venture abroad, often undertaking perilous journeys and straining their new host nations. \nInternational donors and the international community—particularly the United States—have provided billions of dollars to aid these migrants. But what if comparatively smaller sums were used to keep these humanitarian crises from happening in the first place? \nConsider the case of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, three Central American countries that are known as the “Northern Triangle.” Each is under assault from a combination of poverty, ruthless gangs, and transnational crime. Over the last ten years, almost three million people from these three countries, mostly women and children, have left their communities and headed north, some staying in Mexico and others trying to reach the United States. \nAlmost twenty years ago, the South American nation of Colombia faced a similar crisis because of violence stoked by guerrilla warfare, paramilitary groups, and drug cartels. In that case, a bipartisan group from the U.S. Congress decided to support a long-term plan— Plan Colombia —to fortify the country’s public institutions, train and equip security forces, help fight narcotics traffickers, and expand social programs. For every dollar contributed by U.S. taxpayers, Colombia put in about 19 dollars—on top of the blood, sweat, and tears of countless patriots who longed to reclaim their country. \nContrary to what many initially predicted, Plan Colombia worked, as three consecutive Colombian administrations showed strong political will and carried out a sustained program to dismantle the cartels, increase security, and foster economic activity. Today, millions of Colombians are committed to making their country a better place to live, work and raise their families. \nWe believe a similar strategy can work in Central America. For the past two years, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has been supporting the Alliance for Prosperity of the Northern Triangle. Essentially, this plan seeks to help El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras achieve what Colombia has – to regain control over territory, end the cycle of violence, corruption and impunity, win the confidence of investors, and create conditions for sustained and inclusive economic growth. \nThe Northern Triangle countries are pursuing these goals by vetting, professionalizing, and modernizing their police and criminal justice systems to better fight gangs and transnational crime. They are revamping their tax and customs administrations to boost revenues and make government procurement more transparent. The governments are expanding access to education, healthcare, and other social services. They are providing incentives for businesses to increase investments and create more jobs. \nWhile it is far too soon to declare victory, we are seeing encouraging early results: declining homicide rates, increasing tax revenues, better targeted spending on schools and hospitals, and higher rankings in international business climate indexes. Such efforts, however, will need to be sustained over time if they are to take root. \nJust as Plan Colombia enjoyed strong bipartisan support during the presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, the Alliance for Prosperity of the Northern Triangle has so far received generous U.S. contributions, including $650 million in the latest federal budget. El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have collectively budgeted $5.3 billion for the initiative in the last two years, including $850 million in loans from the IDB. And the Bank is committed to providing an additional $750 million in loans for infrastructure projects over the next five years. \nThis week, we will have an opportunity to learn more about the Central American nations’ most recent progress, political commitment, and future needs when Vice President Pence leads a delegation to meet with the presidents of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in Miami for a conference focused on securing support from the local and international business communities. \nThe conference is co-sponsored by the United States and Mexico, with many partners from the wider international community attending as observers. \nThe goal is to trigger a positive “investment shock” – particularly in much-needed infrastructure that will improve competitiveness and generate jobs. \nThe Trump Administration is committed to making this initiative a pillar of its broader strategy to combat illegal immigration by creating conditions for shared security and economic growth across the hemisphere. Some critics may argue that there are elements of nation-building in this plan, and that each country has the duty to fix its own problems, which is true. There is no doubt that each country must sustain a strong political commitment to confront these challenges. But the United States also shares some responsibility for what is happening in the Northern Triangle, as the American demand for illegal drugs fuels criminal activity in these countries. \nAs was the case in Colombia, nearly all the costs and risks of this effort will be borne by the citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. But as Plan Colombia proved, international support at this critical juncture could be the decisive factor in ensuring a turn-around. \nCreating an environment that accelerates private sector investment in the Northern Triangle countries benefits all involved – the United States and Mexico will see a decrease in the number of economic migrants illegally entering, and the Northern Triangle countries will benefit from increased economic prosperity and domestic cohesion. \nThis environment will further encourage the good people of the Northern Triangle countries to invest in their own countries, start businesses in their communities, and create a virtuous cycle that will provide opportunities for their children to thrive at home. \nTillerson is the U.S. Secretary of State.

      "text": "MADRID (AP) — A Spanish aid organization has rescued 420 migrants attempting the perilous crossing of the Mediterranean Sea to Europe in packed smugglers' boats from Libya.\nLaura Lanuza , spokeswoman for Spain's Proactiva Open Arms aid group, said its crews on Thursday rescued most of the migrants from two packed rubber dinghies and a wooden boat that were sailing in international waters 18 miles (29 kilometers) north of the Libyan coastal town of Sabratha. Each boat had over 130 migrants aboard.\nIn a separate operation, she said 11 people, including a 2-month-old baby with asthma, were rescued from a wooden boat.\nLibya is one of the prime spots for smugglers to launch boats — many unseaworthy — packed with migrants and refugees desperate to reach Europe. At least 1,808 have died this year trying to cross the Mediterranean.",

      "text": "MASSAPEQUA, N.Y. (AP) — Pay up, comrade.\nA decadeslong \"good neighbor\" policy that granted more than 100 free beach passes each summer to Russian diplomats and their families has come to an end in one suburban New York town.\nOyster Bay officials say if residents have to pay for access to the sand and sun, then so do the emissaries from Moscow.\nOne of two Long Island retreats for Russian diplomats working at the United Nations headquarters in New York City had been located in the town until December, when the Obama administration ordered it shut in response to alleged Russian hacking in the 2016 presidential election.\nThere have been reports that the ouster may be reversed under President Donald Trump , but local officials say their decision is based only on local concerns.\n\"Our decision has absolutely nothing to do with anything that is going on in the federal government,\" insists Joseph Saladino , who was appointed Oyster Bay town supervisor earlier this year. The Republican is seeking election to a full term in November. \"If our residents have to pay, they have to pay.\"\nOyster Bay, a township of nearly 300,000 people east of New York City that was once home to former President Theodore Roosevelt , has four beaches on both the Atlantic Ocean and Long Island Sound. Residents can pay a $20 daily fee for access to any of the beaches or buy a seasonal pass for $60. Fees for non-residents range between $50 and $60 a day, and some are open to non-residents only on summer weekdays.\nLatest videos Since the days of the former Soviet Union, the town has provided free beach passes to the diplomats, ostensibly because of their presence at a mansion in Upper Brookville called Elmcroft. The house originally had 27 rooms and 11 baths and was once the home of a former New York governor, Nathan Miller .\nSatellite photography shows the grounds today include a tennis court, gardens, a soccer field and another large, modern building.\nThe Obama administration had claimed the Cold War-era estate, along with one in Maryland, were being used for intelligence activities.\nThe U.S. closed the sites in December and ordered 35 Russian officials to leave the country in retaliation for Moscow's alleged meddling to help President Donald Trump's election chances. Their return has been atop Moscow's wish list since Trump entered office.\nWhen the town received a request this spring from the Russians for 116 free passes, Saladino said he responded, \"Nyet.\"\nHe said he did offer to let them buy seasonal the passes at the residential rate of $60 each, but did not receive a response. A spokesman with the Russian mission to the United Nations did not address the town's decision on the beach passes when reached for comment via email.\nIn a 2014 story in a Long Island weekly newspaper, a Russian mission spokesman, Alexey Zaytsev said \"most of the Russian Mission to the UN staff enjoys the beaches.\"\n\"In any beach facility we meet friendly and attentive people, so we are really thankful to the Oyster Bay authorities and residents for their hospitality.\"\nSaladino's decision appears to be playing well with locals.\n\"We're paying, why shouldn't they?\" said Susan Carfora as she arrived with a friend at Tobay Beach, the largest of the town beaches that sits on the Atlantic Ocean just east of the famed Jones Beach State Park. \"I don't believe in special privileges for anybody,\" added Roseann Celauro .\nMike Davis said he didn't have a problem with the town providing free passes in the past, but said he supports the town decision because of \"the election hacking and stuff. I think they should pay.\"\nIt's still not clear whether the Russians will be permitted to return to the property in Upper Brookville. Officials in Washington recently said high-level negotiations are ongoing. Some elected officials oppose any return.",

      "text": "Select Sires to Acquire Accelerated Genetics BY Wisconsin Ag Connections | June 15, 2017 Home › News › Agricultural News \nTwo of the biggest names in the dairy and livestock artificial insemination industry will soon be joining forces. In a joint release on Tuesday, the Ohio-based Select Sires announced it will acquire the assets of Accelerated Genetics, headquartered in Baraboo, pending the approval of Accelerated’s delegates. \nAccelerated Genetics CEO Janet Keller told Wisconsin Ag Connection that talks between the two cooperatives began several weeks ago and that each of their boards recently reached a unanimous decision to unify the companies. \n“It’s still too early to know if all Accelerated Genetics employees and independent sales reps will be retained after the transition, but we do know that Select Sires liked the fact that our company had strong personal ties with our customers,” Keller said. “Our main goal is to ensure that all of our customers have access to the best genetics and other products available on the market and this transition will help make that a reality.” \nCompany officials with Select Sires went on to say that the decision to blend the two firms coincides with an already collaborative business relationship that began over 16 years ago. \n“Since 2001, [we have] each shared ownership of World Wide Sires, Ltd. World Wide Sires serves as the international marketing arm for both companies in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Oceania,” the companies said in a statement. “The goal is to create a unified cooperative that is second-to-none in the market place dedicated to the producer.” \nDelegates of Accelerated Genetics will meet on June 22 to vote on the proposal. If approved, the co-ops say their member-producers can expect to work with ‘highly qualified, passionate individuals who know and understand the cattle breeding industry.’ © 2017 Nebraska Rural Radio Association.

      "text": "Bill Bush The Columbus Dispatch @ReporterBush\nAuthorities announced Monday that the body of a Worthington teenager who went missing while swimming in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Carolina has been recovered.\nAfter a multi-agency search, divers on Monday recovered the body of Franklin \"Eric\" Clark, according to the Beaufort County sheriff's office.\nThe county coroner's office has scheduled an autopsy at the Medical University of South Carolina to confirm the cause of death, which, based on witness accounts, appears to have been an accidental drowning.\nClark was with a group of Thomas Worthington High School basketball players who were swimming Sunday off the coast of Fripp Island when he apparently became caught in an undertow about 2:30 p.m., the sheriff’s office told a local television station. The boys were there for a team training camp, according to Pete Scully, the school's principal.\nAccording to television station WJCL in Savannah, Georgia, island officials said three players were caught in the rough waters. A coach was able to pull two of the players to safety.\nKate Hines with the local property owners’ association said the boys were in about 8 feet of water when Clark went under. The initial search on Sunday failed to locate the teenager and was suspended at nightfall.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard, Beaufort Marine Rescue and Fripp Island Security all assisted in the search.\nHines said Clark was visiting Fripp Island for the third year in a row with the basketball team, which rents a house with their coach for summer training camp.\n“We are obviously devastated by what has happened. The kids and the staff are struggling,” Scully said.\nbbush@dispatch.com\n@ReporterBush",

      "text": "Pinterest Email \nA new study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows that only two midsize SUV's out of 37 were available with \"good\"-rated headlights. \nThis is the fourth group of vehicles that IIHS has tested and evaluated since it began rating headlights in 2016. The recently adopted headlight ratings by the IIHS have resulted in less models being awarded as an IIHS Top Safety Pick+ as headlights must rate in the \"good\" or \"acceptable\" range to be nominated. \nIIHS gave good or acceptable ratings to just 14 of the 37 midsize SUV models in its most recent study, leaving 23 models in the \"marginal\" or \"poor\" ranges. \n\"As a group, midsize SUV headlights perform slightly better than the other SUVs and pickups we evaluated last year, and that's encouraging,\" IIHS senior research engineer Matt Brumbelow said in a statement. \"Still, we continue to see headlights that compromise safety because they only provide a short view down the road at night.\" \nThe two categories, luxury and non-luxury, each had one model given a good rating for their best available headlight system. The 2017 Volvo XC60 from the luxury side and the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe from the non-luxury side. \nAccording to IIHS, most headlights in vehicles have one of three different light sources, which include halogen, high-intensity discharge (HID) or LED. One of these sources is then paired with either reflectors or projector lenses. Projector headlights use one lens to spread light while reflectors have multiple surfaces that bounce light forward. Adaptive headlights aim to be the next must-have safety feature \nJust as cars without rearview cameras as standard equipment are beginning to look stingy or outdated in the marketplace, plain old headlights that do not track the road ahead may be the next safety ... \nEach of the good and acceptable-rated headlights in the test done by IIHS have projector lenses, and the good-rated vehicles also have HID light sources. \nThe XC60 has curve-adaptive HID projector headlights available, which earned it the top rating. The XC60 is also available with optional high-beam assist that automatically switches the lights from high to low beam. The good-rated HID headlights are available if XC60 purchasers upgrade to the \"advanced package\" or the \"active dual xenon headlights package.\" \nThe Santa Fe has curve-adaptive HID projector headlights with high-beam assist like the XC60. The good-rated headlights are available in the \"tech package\" which can be added on to the two \"ultimate\" versions of the Santa Fe, the \"SE Ultimate\" and \"Limited Ultimate\" but not the two more basic versions, the \"SE\" and the \"Limited,\" according to its website . \nAccording to IIHS, the Santa Fe's base halogen headlights earn a poor rating due to inadequate visibility. \nThere are 79 different headlight combinations available for the 37 midsize SUV models that IIHS tested. The best available lights indicated the ratings for the model. \nEngineers at IIHS measure how far light is projected from the low beams as well as high beams as the vehicle drives straight and around curves. Glare for oncoming vehicles is another factor to make sure that low beams aren't creating excessive glare.",

      "text": "1h ago • 1 min read \nIt appears the Hawks are heading for another interesting summer as they try to hang onto forward Paul Millsap . Last summer, they lost Al Horford in free agency and replaced him by signing Dwight Howard , so the front office is facing another fight to keep a key frontcourt performer. \nMillsap has been an integral piece the past four seasons, but decided to opt out of the final year of his deal to become a free agent . Atlanta would love to keep Millsap, but new GM Travis Schlenk has indicated Millsap likely will not be offered a max deal. \nThat comes from a report by Chris Vivlamore, which also notes that Schlenk said Millsap \"might get better offers than we can make him.\" Via the Atlanta Journal-Constitution : \nNew general manager Travis Schlenk told to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that retaining Millsap remains a priority. However, he acknowledged that Millsap may receive better offers elsewhere as an unrestricted free agent next month. \n\"We are going to make Paul our best offer,\" Schlenk said this week. \"Will he have better offers? I don't know. Do we want to keep Paul? Sure. I said last week, if you are building a team with all the things I've said, Paul checks all those boxes. He's a hard-worker. He's a good guy. He's high-character. Skilled. He does all that stuff. We'd like to have him. The reality is, he might get better offers than we can make him.\" \nIn his report, Vivlamore notes Millsap is eligible to make $205M over five years on a max deal from the Hawks. If he leaves, the most he could make is $152M over four years. \nThe Hawks are in an interesting spot. They seemed to be ready to tear things down in the middle of the season, as they gave away Kyle Korver for basically nothing, but rallied to finish as the East's No. 5 seed before losing to the Washington Wizards in six games in the first round of the playoffs.",

      "text": "STEVEN ERLANGER, New York Times\nLONDON — More than 200 firefighters from all over London were struggling to contain a major fire at a tall apartment block in the west of the city early Wednesday, with fears that people are trapped in the burning building.\nAccording to the London Fire Brigade and the Metropolitan Police, the fire broke out at 1:16 a.m. and quickly engulfed a high-rise apartment building called Grenfell Tower in North Kensington.\nThe authorities were evacuating the 27-story building, which contains about 120 apartments. The London Fire Brigade said the flames had spread from the second floor to the 27th floor. The Metropolitan Police said that an evacuation was underway and that ‘‘a number of people’’ were being treated ‘‘for a range of injuries.’’\nDan Daly, an assistant fire commissioner, said: ‘‘Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus are working extremely hard in very difficult conditions to tackle this fire. This is a large and very serious incident and we have deployed numerous resources and specialist appliances.’’\nPhotos and videos posted on social media showed flames shooting out one side of the building.\nAt least 40 fire engines were attending the fire. It is unclear whether firefighters had equipment that could reach to the top of the building.\nWitnesses said they could see lights — thought to be flashlights — blinking at the top of the block of apartments.\nGeorge Clarke, an architect and television personality, who said he was 100 yards away, told the BBC: ‘‘I’m getting covered in ash. That’s how bad it is.’’\nHe continued: ‘‘It’s so heartbreaking. I’ve seen someone flashing their torches at the top level and they obviously can’t get out.’’\nTim Downey, another witness, told the BBC that part of the building was ‘‘completely burned away.’’\n_informq.push(['embed']);\nHe said: ‘‘It looks very bad, very very bad. I’ve never seen anything like this. It’s just such a big fire. The whole building is just crumbling. It’s just billowing black smoke.’’",

      "text": "One month 'til franchise tag deadline, two Kirk Cousins quotes stand out One month 'til franchise tag deadline, two Kirk Cousins quotes stand out Nats pitchers are allowing a league high 4 HR per 9 innings \nBy now every Redskins fan knows the story. Heck, every NFL fan knows the story. If the Redskins and Kirk Cousins can't get a long-term deal done in the next month, the quarterback will play his second straight season on the franchise tag. In turn he will make $24 million, guaranteed, and be eligible for free agency in 2018. \nWhile the Redskins and Cousins have voiced positivity over the last several weeks about contract talks, still, little actual movement towards a deal has transpired. The team promoted Doug Williams to run football personnel this week, but Williams himself said Eric Schaffer would continue to run point on the Cousins contract, with the help of Bruce Allen and perhaps even Dan Snyder. \nWhat do the promotions mean to Cousins? \nThis quote jumped out from Wednesday when Cousins was asked about his relationship with Schaffer. \nEric’s done a great job all along. He’s very smart. This isn’t his first rodeo. I have a lot of faith in him not only in handling my situation, but when my situation is handled, handling everybody else’s. I have faith in that. But make no mistake, there are titles ahead of him, you know? And those people make decisions too. So, yes, Eric has a big role. There are people above him who have bigger roles, and that’s why their titles are President and Head Coach and so on. So it’s a team effort making decisions and Eric certainly has a voice in that – a big voice. \nRead it again. Cousins knows this decision will likely come from Allen and Snyder. That's fair too, as the organization will likely have to offer a contract with a value north of $120 million. That is crazy cash, even by NFL standards. \nIt's also interesting Cousins mentioned the head coach's role. Jay Gruden named Cousins the Redskins starting QB before the 2015 season. The move rewarded both men and the team, yet, Cousins' statement almost suggests he questions if his coach has advocated for a deal. Or that as Gruden's role in the organization has grown - as has been reported by CSN and elsewhere - perhaps his increased clout can get a deal done. \nOne other quote stood out. Cousins talked about his agent, Mike McCartney, and their saga. \nI hired Mike [McCartney] because I trust him to do the job and I feel like he’s done a very good job all the way along and while things he’s told me I haven’t always liked to hear or they haven’t always been easy to act on, he’s always been right as I look back. So I have great trust in his counsel and his approach and I’ll definitely be leaning on him as we go forward all the way through it. \nMcCartney has been steadfast that the franchise tag sets the annual value for any long-term contract. That means last year McCartney would not enter into negotiations with Cousins making less than $20 million per year. This year, that figures jumps to $24 million per year. \nAsked about the $24 million annual salary, Schaffer said he could not talk about specific contract numbers. With the news that Snyder is growing more involved, perhaps the Redskins will get to that number, but the clock is ticking. \nThough he was fired by the organization in March, former general manager Scot McCloughan only said nice things about the Redskins since his exit. He did have some interesting comments about McCartney, however, as it related to Cousins' contract. \n\"It's a big business,\" McCloughan said ( click here for full audio ). \"The agent's got to be understandable that they're involved in it too. It's not just us and the player, the agent has to be able to understand.\" \nSpeaking with people close to the Redskins, there has been some tension between McCartney and the brass. The perception is that Cousins' agent wants to squeeze every dime out of this contract, with the visibility of this deal magnified around the NFL. \nListen to Cousins, and he clearly trusts McCartney. He should, in two seasons, Cousins stands to make $44 million. If you're the client, your agent's job is to get every dollar. \nThe Redskins have one month to pay up for a long-term deal, or this saga will begin anew after the 2017 season. Just listen.",

      "text": "Redskins top pick Jonathan Allen progressing slowly, by design \nWe haven’t heard much about Jonathan Allen, the Redskins’ top pick in the draft, during the Redskins’ OTAs and minicamp. That doesn’t necessarily mean that Allen is struggling or behind schedule. \nThe nature of the offseason program is one reason why it has been difficult for Allen to stand out. The practice in conducted in helmets and shorts and there is no contact allowed. As much as any position, the defensive line is about contact. \n“All we can work on right now is the work ethic and how they’re picking up the system, where they’re fitting, where they’re getting their hands on people,” said Gruden. “But as far as shedding and rushing, it’s really hard. It’s hard to go out here and coach team drills and say ‘OK, we’re competing but don’t compete because we’re not live and we can’t hit anybody.’ It’s a fine line. It’s hard to coach that.” \nRELATED: Hall, Redskins agree to new contract \nLike all the rookies, Allen got a late start in the offseason program. By the time he was drafted and participated in rookie camp on May 13, the veterans had been working together learning Greg Manusky’s new defense and the ways of new defensive line coach Jim Tomsula for almost a month. Add in to Allen, of course, being new to pro football and he had a lot to learn. \n“It’s been a lot of work, a lot of catching up to do to catch up with the guys,” Allen said early in the OTA schedule. “Really, just doing whatever I can to jump on board and get better, help the team win some ball games, that’s what it’s about.” \nTomsula, who comes in with a reputation as a defensive line guru, said that he is bringing Allen along slowly. \n“There’s a big curve here,” he said. “I’m not going to throw him to the wolves, you know. I have a president and a vice president and a head coach and a defensive coordinator who agree with that. Everybody wants to see him walk in, get in that spot, and go. We’re not going to do that. We’re going to let him learn and understand what we’re doing and then go after it.” \nIt’s a learning curve for all of them because it’s a new defense. But that guy’s coming from college. It’s a different game. It is. Everybody can say what they want but in there at that position it’s a different game. \nMORE REDSKINS: Redskins Practice report: Wrapping up minicamp \nThe head coach seems to be happy with the No. 17 overall pick. \n“High, you know, very high,” he said when asked about his opinion of Allen’s progress. “Coach Tomsula is working him very hard. He’s going to get stronger. He’s going to do a much better job in the weight room getting himself in better shape. He works hard. Very smart football player, can play multiple spots on the line. He’s got physical, strong hands. He can shed blockers with ease. So I have been impressed with him. I think he is going to be a heck of a player for us for a long time.” \nThe part about the weight room and getting stronger is often overlooked. Certainly, Allen was in a top-notch conditioning program in college at Alabama. But preparing for the combine and pro days and team workouts take away from their strength conditioning. By the time the strength and conditioning staff at Redskins Park got a hold of him and the rest of the rookies, a lot of workout time had passed. \nAllen still will be learning and getting stronger when training camp comes around. He could get off to a slow start but there seems to be little doubt that there will be appearing often in opponents’ backfields sooner rather than later. \nStay up to date on the Redskins!

      "text": "Cubans brace for worst as Trump takes aim at Obama opening By MICHAEL WEISSENSTEIN, ANDREA RODRIGUEZ and ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON - 6/15/17 9:03 PM \nMARIEL, Cuba— Church bells rang out and Cubans strung American flags from their windows when President Barack Obama announced in December 2014 that the U.S. would stop trying to push Cuba toward collapse. \nObama’s new policy of engagement unleashed a flood of American visitors, pumping cash into Cuba’s nascent private sector, even as the centrally planned economy hit its first recession in nearly a quarter century. Many Cubans did better. But most lives remained a grinding daily struggle. Jubilation faded to resignation. \nPresident Donald Trump on Friday is expected to give America’s Cuba policy its second major change in three years during an appearance in Miami, reviving the Cold War goal of starving Cuba’s communist system of cash. Stopping short of a complete turnabout, Trump will announce a revised policy aimed at stopping the flow of U.S. dollars to the country’s military and security services while maintaining diplomatic relations and allowing U.S. airlines and cruise ships to continue service to the island, White House officials said Thursday. \nOrdinary Cubans have been bracing for the worst. Across the island, people of all ages, professions and political beliefs expect rising tensions and fewer American visitors. And while some Cuban exiles in South Florida are celebrating, others question the wisdom of undoing a policy that had started showing results by increasing the number of Cubans economically independent of the government. \nIn 1980, some 125,000 Cubans fled the port of Mariel on boats to the U.S. in the largest single exodus of refugees in modern Cuban history. Today, the city 30 miles west of Havana is home to the county’s main cargo facility, where freighters unload containers of supplies for the country’s booming tourism industry. \nA few miles from the gates of the port, 42-year-old Yosvani Reinoso works as a self-employed locksmith from a stand on Mariel’s main square. He hasn’t seen his life improve much since the U.S. and Cuba re-established friendly relations, but the restart of commercial flights after a half-century gave his wife hope she could afford to visit her 19-year-old son who emigrated to the U.S. two years ago. \n“The best thing that can happen for the two countries is for all of these problems to end, for everything to be normal,” Reinoso said. \nIn Havana, 53-year-old hairdresser Dioslans Castillo said Obama’s 2016 visit to Havana and his calls for Cubans to seize control of their economic destiny had inspired him to try to open a bar with gourmet food and cultural activities for LGBT Cubans. \n“Obama incentivized entrepreneurship,” Castillo said. “His visit influenced society because the people saw the so-called opening, despite it happening in slow steps compared to the rhetoric. But with Trump, it’s all going to crash.” \nSpeaking from Miami, where he was working with anti-Castro Cuban-American groups ahead of Friday’s announcement, Cuban dissident Antonio Rodiles said he supports Trump’s plans and many ordinary Cubans do as well. \n“Many, many people are telling me that we have to squeeze the government once and for all,” Rodiles said. “And many people I meet in the street have much tougher opinions than mine.” \nAlso in Miami, Roberto Pique, who left Cuba at age 15 in 1961, said that even though he wanted the Castro family to leave power, Obama’s actions had allowed Cubans to have more access to information. The number of Cuban-Americans traveling to Cuba has increased and the government has opened hundreds of public Wi-Fi spots since the warming, greatly expanding internet access. \n“Obama was a very wise man. He had something in mind, like playing chess with those people, the communists over there,” Pique said. “The Cubans have more access to what’s happening in the world because there are so many people traveling over there, their families,” added the retired juvenile probation officer. “I don’t think anything that (Trump) will do will help us get rid of those communists in Cuba. They have survived worse, unfortunately.” \nEven opponents of Obama’s policy said they didn’t expect much from Trump’s proposal. \n“He will make the same promises that the last 10 presidents have made Cuban-Americans here in Miami and nothing happens,” said Raul Masvidal, 75, a financial adviser who arrived in the U.S. in 1960 from the eastern Cuban city of Camaguey. “Outside the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 when you really look back to the last 50 years, nothing has been done. Castro is still there. Different first name.” \nStanding in front of a primary school in Mariel, 56-year-old teacher Juan Manuel Lemus said he had hoped Obama’s opening would lead Cuban-Americans to invest in businesses in his decaying industrial hometown, the same way many had poured money into tourist centers like Havana. \n“There are a lot of Americans and Cuban-Americans who have family here and more investment would be good for us,” he said. \nBut his immediate worry is much more personal. \n“I have a son, my oldest, in the United States,” Lemus said. “I’m afraid, really, about what happens if Trump cuts back relations. He’s in Tampa, painting houses, and the more open things are between the U.S. and Cuba, the better.” \nAssociated Press writers Michael Weissenstein and Andrea Rodriguez reported this story in Cuba and AP writer Adriana Gomez Licon reported from Miami.

      "text": "Palestinian government bans news sites critical of president By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH - 6/15/17 11:06 AM \nRAMALLAH, West Bank — The Palestinian government in the West Bank has blocked 11 news websites affiliated with Hamas and other political rivals critical of President Mahmoud Abbas. \nAn official at the attorney general’s office of the Palestinian Authority says the sites were blocked because they are in “violation of the rules of publications,” which forbid alleged fake news and defamation. The official spoke anonymously Thursday because he was not authorized to brief the media. \nThe editor of Jordan-based Amad news website, Hassan Asfour, said in a statement that the censorship was due to its “bold reporting” on the Palestinian government’s “dirty deals.” \nThe internationally backed Palestinian Authority has tightened its grip in the West Bank since losing control of the Gaza Strip to the Islamic militant group Hamas a decade ago.

Like her mom and dad, she’s a HUGE Predators fans, and when their team fell to Sidney Crosby and the Penguins in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals, they were all really bummed out. \nFortunately, like most toddlers Wrigley has a pretty sunny disposition, so she’s optimistic about the Predators’ chances next year. When her mom sat her down to make a video message for the team, it was pretty much the cutest thing ever and went viral in no time. \nTake a look: A post shared by reagan (@reaganmandile) on Jun 12, 2017 at 5:53pm PDT \nSeriously, she is just ridiculously cute. \nOf course, a quick look at her mom’s Instagram reveals that they are no ordinary Predators fans. Turns out Wrigley’s dad is Steve Mandile , who plays guitar and does vocals for the country group Sixwire. So they get some VIP treatment at Bridgestone Arena. \nThey are legit hardcore fans, though. Take a look at these other Preds-related posts from her mom, Reagan: \nA post shared by reagan (@reaganmandile) on Apr 18, 2017 at 4:47pm PDT A post shared by reagan (@reaganmandile) on May 2, 2017 at 10:23pm PDT \nA post shared by reagan (@reaganmandile) on May 13, 2017 at 11:30am PDT A post shared by reagan (@reaganmandile) on May 22, 2017 at 2:14pm PDT \nA post shared by reagan (@reaganmandile) on May 29, 2017 at 8:19pm PDT A post shared by reagan (@reaganmandile) on Jun 5, 2017 at 9:51pm PDT \nMove over Vince Gill . Wrigley Mandile is the Preds’ new #1 fan. \nOh, and PS, Wrigley is named after the baseball stadium. Reagan Mandile is a HUGE Cubs fan.  ",

(CBSNewYork) — A wheelchair accessible minivan stolen from a Long Island driveway has been found by police and returned to its grateful owner. \nClaire Helfenbein, 52, of Hempstead, was born with a defect and has never walked a day in her life. \nMoving to American from Trinidad gave her the chance to be independent. \nBut she lost that independence when her van was stolen from her Byrd Avenue home on May 21, leaving her unable to get around and drive her 12-year-old son with autism to school. \nThe customized van, which was donated by an anonymous donor from her church, was fully equipped with a special seat, ramp and hand controls. \nOfficers recovered the vehicle in East Meadow over the weekend and returned it to Helfenbein on Wednesday. \n“Oh my god, I mean it’s such a blessing,” Helfenbein said. “I am so thankful and I feel so glad that there were so many people so concerned and so kind.” \nShe’ll need to replace a tire, but otherwise the van is in prefect condition. \n“I can’t believe how good God is that my van would go missing for all this time and God is so good that it was returned,” Helfenbein said. “I am truly, truly grateful.” \nNo arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing.

Western Michigan University-Cooley Law School asked in January for his conviction to be set aside, and the Wayne County prosecutor's office agreed. \nThe law school's Innocence Project says police used a single hair to tie Watkins to the killing. The prosecutor's office says conclusions made in the 1970s don't match current scientific standards. \nWatkins is now 61 years old. He was 20 when he was sentenced in 1976 to life without parole for first-degree murder.  ",

This year's heavy snowfall has crews working to clear Highway 120, the only road through Y... By RICH PEDRONCELLI and BRIAN MELLEY\nYOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) - There may be no more potent reminder of California's humongous snowfall than the plows still clearing roads that snake across the state's highest mountains as summer approaches. \nCrews have been digging, blowing and blasting for months - and the work is not finished, though an approaching heat wave could speed up the process. \n\"We're almost at the middle of June and we still have lots of passes that aren't open,\" said Florene Trainor, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation. \nFew roads traverse the Sierra Nevada, the rocky spine running 400 miles up the state that is home to Yosemite National Park. Mountain passes are typically open by Memorial Day. \nThe only road through Yosemite, Highway 120, remained closed this week as crews dig out from snows that topped 20 feet and drifted well over 50 feet. \nOn a recent day, the park's entrance station at 9,945-foot high Tioga Pass was buried in snow. \nBut the serenity of the Sierra Nevada, with birds chirping beneath snow-crested peaks that tower above 12,000 feet, was shaken by the roar and beep of plows, excavators and massive machines carving through 15-foot snowbanks and moving giant blocks of snow. Big snow blowers sent plumes arcing through the air and off the side of the road. \nAs the Caltrans crew dug the entrance out from the east, a crew from the park was working from the west to clear the road that winds its way to Yosemite Valley, the park's top destination. \nCaltrans had begun inching its way up the road more than two months ago when it seemed more like winter. It snowed on and off throughout the spring, with a late-season storm hitting last weekend. \nThe air is clean and views are stunning, but working here is not for the faint of heart as drivers maneuver large machines along narrow ribbons that feel suspended above an abyss. Helicopter footage shot this spring for Caltrans showed the small margin for error in places where the road clung to cliffs and then vanished under a white blanket where the path was obscured. \n\"It's spooky, it's nerve-wracking ... especially when you can't see the road. You're on a big sled,\" said Clint Weier, a maintenance superintendent with Caltrans. \"Some of our operators up here have had some wow factors.\" \nAvalanches stampede down granite walls, taking trees and rocks with them that choke roads. In one section, tree trunks and branches from a previous slide poked from sheer snowbanks littered with pine needles and other debris from a previous snow slide. \nRockslides pose a threat even after workers use charges and other methods to release snow slides to alleviate the danger. Slides and the crushing weight of the snowpack damaged guardrails in some places that serve as the lone barrier between the road and a precipitous drop that plunges hundreds of feet east of the park entrance. \nA Yosemite plow driver was killed by an avalanche in 1995 and now maintenance workers in the park complete avalanche safety courses to work on the road, park spokesman Scott Gediman said. \nThe park's official map notes that the eastern entrance atop the state's highest automobile pass is typically closed through May, but it usually opens later after a snowy winter, Gediman said Tuesday. There's no date yet to open the road through the park. \nJust to the north of the park, Sonora Pass opened Tuesday. Ebbetts Pass farther north remains closed, said Skip Allum, a Caltrans spokesman. To the south, crews plowed the road over Minaret Summit near Mammoth Mountain ski area. \nIn Lassen Volcanic National Park, much farther north, deep snow still buries the road that circles the southernmost peak in the Cascade Range. The road is expected to open in early July. \nThe snowpack presented an additional challenge this year because it was heavily saturated with water. The dense and frozen snow was harder to cut through, heavier to move and broke equipment, Paul Jensen, a Caltrans plow driver, said. \nJensen has been working overtime all spring to get the road into Yosemite open and hasn't minded working weekends. He considers it a labor of love. \n\"Twenty years and I'm still not tired of it,\" Jensen said. \"It's my favorite time of the year.\" \n___ \nMelley reported from Los Angeles.

      "text": "Senate Dems want to eliminate business tax deduction to boost budget Thursday Jun 15, 2017 at 11:11 AM Jim Siegel The Columbus Dispatch @phrontpage \nOhio Senate Democrats want to eliminate Ohio’s business income tax deduction, a move they say would produce $2.2 billion over two years to fill the state budget’s revenue shortfall and put more money into the opioid crisis, education and local governments. \nSenate Minority Leader Kenny Yuko, D-Richmond Heights, said Ohio needs to follow the lead of Kansas lawmakers, who, in the midst of another budget messs, recently over-rode their governor’s veto and eliminated a similar business tax deduction there. \n“Some lawmakers will tell you there’s not enough money to go around,” Yuko said. “But our real problem right now is irresponsible tax policy. Right now we’re throwing money on a tax break that is not creating jobs.” \nIn Ohio, business owners who are set up as pass-through entities such as sole proprietors, partnerships or LLCs, do not have to pay income tax on their first $250,000 in income. The wealthiest filers also get an additional 40 percent tax break, paying a 3 percent tax rate on income over $250,000, instead of the 5-percent rate established in law for all other filers. \n“The real estate investor avoids paying state taxes, while his secretary still has to pay,” said Sen. Michael Skindell, D-Lakewood. “That scenario does not create a fair shot for everyone in this economy.” \nSenate Republicans on Monday proposed budget changes designed to fill an anticipated $1 billion budget shortfall that is a result of weak tax revenue, particularly from the income tax. \nThe Kasich administration in April warned lawmakers that tax revenues were coming in below estimates so they should adjust his introduced budget by $800 million. As revenues continue to come in low, Senate President Larry Obhof, R-Medina, took that figure to $1 billion, noting this week that the Senate's amended budget was not pain-free. \nYuko said he has a pain-free solution. His members want to eliminate the business tax break in Ohio to fill that $1 billion hole, plus have money for additional spending, including: \n-$200 million for the opioid crisis. This would initially come from the rainy day fund to provide an instant infusion of money for services and treatment, and that money would be repaid to the fund over the two-year budget. \n-$200 million for Medicaid and human services. This includes increased funding for adult and child protective services. \n-$250 million for K-12 education. No district would see a funding cut, and recent losses in tangible personal property tax reimbursements would be restored. \n-$200 million for higher education. This includes more money for university operations and the state’s needs-based grants for students. \n-$350 million for local government. This includes addressing the $200 million a year counties and transit authorities would lose from the sales tax no longer applying to Medicaid managed care services. \nAccording to a Legislative Service Commission analysis, eliminating the business tax relief would mean an extra $2.1 billion for the state general revenue fund, plus about $36 million each for the local government and library funds. \nOhio GOP legislative leaders who see eliminating the deduction as a tax increase on business owners have thus far expressed no interest in doing away with it, though some legislative Republicans have recently questioned the effectiveness and structure of the deduction. \nAsked about business owners who say the tax deduction has helped them afford new equipment, or give an employee a raise, Skindell wasn’t buying it. \n“Giving the secretary a raise is not based on this tax cut,” Skindell said. “Does it benefit the business owner? Absolutely. They can buy a better condo in Florida or Arizona.” \nCritics of the tax deduction have noted that Ohio’s job creation numbers have continued to lag the national average. Obhof has countered that Ohio’s tax reforms, including across-the-board income tax cuts, have helped create hundreds of thousands of jobs. \nSenate Democrats say they do not view their proposal as a tax increase. \n“What we’re doing is creating fairness,” Yuko said. \n",

      "text": "A phone app is helping doctors have difficult conversations with patients about lowering doses of opioids. Primary care doctors prescribe nearly half the opioids dispensed in the U.S. They're increasingly being called upon to stem the flow of the highly addictive pills into medicine cabinets. That means writing lower-dose or shorter-term prescriptions for some patients, helping others taper off high doses and refusing opioids entirely to others. The shift enrages some patients. \"People will blow up. We have to call security. They can get very mean,\" said Dr. Ashley Ruby, a Philadelphia family physician. U.S. public health officials developed an app to help doctors practice a technique called motivational interviewing. It's part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's opioid guidelines app, which also has a dosage calculator and a copy of the first national prescribing guidelines. The app, released in December, includes these tips for doctors: -Ask open-ended questions. This increases the patient's involvement in the discussion and allows for more meaningful conversation. For example: \"What are some of your goals as we manage your pain?\" -Reflect. Reflective listening helps the patient feel understood. For example: \"It sounds like you miss being able to play with your grandchildren.\" -Express empathy. \"A lot of people are concerned about managing their pain if the amount of opioids is decreased.\" -Evoke \"change talk.\" ''What would you like to see different about your life right now?\" -Develop discrepancies. Help patients see the difference between their current behavior and their goals. \"You've told me that exercise helps you have more energy and reduces stiffness. Why do you think it's been hard for you to get more active?\" -Provide affirmation. \"I am glad to see your endurance is improving with physical therapy. Keep it up!\" In the app, doctors can try a hypothetical conversation with a virtual patient. Red \"try again\" messages or green, congratulatory messages pop up when the doctor picks what to say next.",

      "text": "Girl screams 'daddy don't' while being stabbed to death KCEN 4:56 AM. EDT June 15, 2017 John Singleton. Photo: Cooke County Jail CHICAGO (AP) - A Cook County judge has ordered a Chicago man held without bail in the stabbing death of a 12-year-old girl. Assistant State's Attorney Guy Lisuzzo said Tuesday that Alexis Stubbs can be heard on voicemail screaming \"daddy don't\" while she was stabbed late Sunday. John Singleton is charged with first-degree murder in her death. Lisuzzo says the 31-year-old Singleton and the girl's mother were arguing over the phone when the girl's cries were recorded. Police say Singleton previously served jail time for attacking the girl's mother. An assistant public defender told the judge Tuesday that Singleton has a history of mental health problems and suicidal thoughts. The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services said it had contact with Alexis last year over a child-neglect allegation it determined wasn't credible. ",

Clothing, shoes and other items were strewn on the ground beside pools of blood. The videos showed ambulances arriving and medics wheeling people into an emergency room. \nKindergartens in China have been targeted before in apparent revenge attacks carried out by mentally ill people or those bearing grudges against their neighbors and society.

      "text": "Trump attacks obstruction of justice probe by former FBI chief Mueller David Jackson , USA TODAY , TEGNA 9:32 AM. EDT June 15, 2017 President Trump (Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nPresident Trump on Thursday criticized reports that he is now under investigation for obstruction of justice in connection with the firing of FBI Director James Comey, denouncing it as another \"witch hunt\" that is unfairly targeting him. \n\"They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story,\" Trump tweeted. \"Nice.\" \nTrump followed up about an hour later with another critical tweet: \"You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history — led by some very bad and conflicted people!\" They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2017 You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2017 \nTrump appeared to be a responding to a Washington Post report that special prosecutor Robert Mueller \"is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said.\" \nWhile the Justice Department appointed Mueller to investigate Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election — and any \"collusion\" with the Trump campaign — his assignment also includes \"any matters that arose or may arise” from the Russia probe. \nComey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he believes Trump fired him last month because he resisted a request to drop the Russia investigation, especially as it related to former national security adviser Michael. Flynn. \nTrump said he fired Comey for poor performance, though he ealso reportedly told a group of Russian officials that the Comey dismissal would help get the Russia probe behind him. He also called Comey a \"nut job.\" Rosenstein named Mueller \nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel shortly after Comey's firing. Rosenstein was acting, because Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from acting in the Russia investigation after it was revealed he had held two meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before the Nov. 8, 2016 election. \nNews that Mueller is now investigating Trump for obstruction of justice comes amid reports that Trump has discussed whether to remove the special counsel. White House officials said the president is not considering such a step. \nSupporters of Trump condemned the news leaks regarding the new investigation. \n\"The FBI leak of information regarding the President is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal,\" said Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump's legal team. \nIt is possible, however, that the sources for the Post report could have been those interviewed as part of the investigation, not the investigators themselves. \nIn the most famous presidential investigation, Watergate, Archibald Cox was appointed special prosecutor on May 18, 1973 — by June 5, Nixon was complaining about being attacked by Cox. That October, Nixon had Cox fired, leading eventually to House impeachment hearings and the president's resignation. \nTrump is not the first president to be subjected to a special counsel investigation, nor the first president to protest it. \nDuring the 1990s, President Bill Clinton and supporters protested the investigation of independent counsel Kenneth Starr, which began as a probe of the Whitewater real estate deal and ended with Clinton's impeachment on charges of perjury and obstruction regarding his relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky. \n© 2017 USATODAY.COM ",

      "text": "Close Student freed from North Korea suffered 'severe neurological injury' A University of Virginia student has been suddenly released from a North Korean prison where he's been held for 17 months. USA TODAY Network , TEGNA 11:15 AM. EDT June 15, 2017 Otto Warmbier of Cincinnati was in North Korea with a tour group when officials there detained him. (Photo: Submitted to USA TODAY) \nWYOMING, OHIO - In strong words, the father of an American college student who was detained in North Korea, slammed the country as a terroristic nation, but he had little to say about his son's condition. \n\"They are a pariah regime,\" said Fred Warmbier. \"They're brutal and terroristic.\" \nOtto Warmbier, 22, returned to Ohio on Tuesday after being detained and imprisoned for 18 months in North Korea. Otto is in a coma. His father said he is stable, \"but has suffered a severe neurological injury.\" \n\"We don't believe anything they say. We see the results of their actions with Otto,\" Fred Warmbier said Thursday. \nSome media reports said the North Koreans suggested Otto Warmbier had come down with a case of botulism and fell into a coma after being given a sleeping pill — an account questioned by a number of officials. \nWarmbier said North Korea took his son hostage at the airport, but he doesn't believe his family will ever know the real reason Otto was released. \n\"I don't think we'll ever find the answer,\" he said. \"North Korea doesn't do anything out of the kindness of their heart.\" \nNorth Korea gives first explanation \nNorth Korea said Thursday it released Warmbier over \"humanitarian\" reasons, its first official comment since he was returned to his home state of Ohio in a coma. \nThe state-run Korean Central News Agency said Warmbier had been serving hard labor but didn't comment on his medical condition or how the country negotiated his release with the United States. \n\"Warmbier, who had been in hard labor, was sent back home on June 13, 2017, on humanitarian grounds according to the adjudication made on the same day by the Central Court of the DPRK,\" the agency said in the one-sentence report, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. \nWarmbier's parents had relentlessly pressed — first behind the scenes and then more publicly — for their son’s release. \n“I want my kid home. He doesn’t deserve this,” Fred Warmbier told The Cincinnati Enquirer in an interview last month. \n'I want my kid home' \nDuring his incarceration, the Warmbiers only heard from their son once — through a letter on March 2, 2016. He noted that the North Koreans had refused to let Swedish officials — the United States' diplomatic intermediaries in that country — visit or contact Otto for more than a year. \n“Since March 2nd, no one has seen or heard from Otto. No one,” Fred Warmbier said last month. \nIt was apparently shortly after that date when Warmbier fell ill. \nContributing: Deirdre Shesgreen, USA TODAY.

      "text": "Close What was your kid's most expensive mistake? Father's Day edition Ahead of Mother's Day, the MagnifyMoney team asked moms to reveal some of the more expensive mistakes their kids have made - and who covered the bill. Brittney Laryea / MagnifyMoney , KHOU 11:07 AM. EDT June 15, 2017 Father showing finger to his son to solve conflict between them (Photo: bbevren, bbevren) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nWhile there are many joys that come with raising kids, parents are quick to admit raising a child comes with a host of unexpected expenses. More often than not, the bill comes at fault of the child, but it’s the parent who signs a check to cover it. \nMagnifyMoney recently published a video sharing New York City moms’ stories about most expensive mistakes their kids have made. The video inspired other parents from all over the U.S. to comment with stories of their own children’s mistakes. \nWe thought we’d share the best stories with you ahead of Father’s Day, so we pulled together some of the top cringeworthy confessions. Here are a few of the most expensive mistakes parents sat their kids made. The $25,000 eBay shopping spree \nFarrah Severs-Young was just trying to remember the passwords to her online accounts. She realized the admittedly ineffective hack she used to do so was flawed when she got bills for Star Wars stuff her son bid for on Ebay totalling about $25,000. The $5,000 load of laundry \nTim Fry says his tween’s absentmindedness caused a freak laundry room accident that cost these he and his wife $5000. The $48,000 bathroom nightmare \nWIth the purchase of pull-ups and special potties made for little ones, potty training can get expensive, but this Powell, Tenn. mother didn’t expect it to run them $48,000. \nFortunately, the house could be repaired — unlike the $20,000 of jewelry this mother lost because of her child’s trip to the bathroom. The “Dirty” iPad “My kiddo...killed over $1k worth of fish and coral.” 1 Hoverboard = 2 surgeries + $26,000 in medical bills A $2,500 ear experiment \nThis child’s explorative spirit ended with a trip to the hospital, which then resulted in a $2,500 bill for his mom, Mistee Hansen in Boise, Idaho. Goodbye, college scholarships \nWe can just feel Sandra Bettis rolling her eyes as she’s reminded of the time she advised her kid to always “follow your heart” when it came time to choose a college. Unfortunately, her daughter’s heart was not set on the school that offered her $152,000 in scholarship money. \nJennifer Brooks from Atlanta, Ga. says her daughter “developed senioritis” her last year of high school, ditching class and ultimately hurting her grades so badly that she lost a college scholarship. Again, Brooks doesn’t mention the value of the forgone scholarship, but it’s safe to assume any help with the average $20,090 it cost to attend the average in-state four year institution would help. 15 pies don’t come cheap The $6,000 autograph \nLisa Whittaker from Tampa Bay, Fla. says when he was just learning how to write his name, she drove around with her young son’s name scribbled onto the side of her minivan so he wouldn’t think he made a mistake in practicing his penmanship on the car with a rock. It cost her $6,000 to erase the child’s writing. \nMagnifyMoney is a price comparison and financial education website, founded by former bankers who use their knowledge of how the system works to help you save money. \n",

Or at least, very dumb. But help might, finally, be on the way. Bob Sullivan . MagnifyMoney , KHOU 11:17 AM. EDT June 15, 2017 (Photo: Ingram Publishing, This content is subject to copyright.) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nIf you're afraid to answer your phone, you're hardly alone. Spam calls have become so common that they've basically rendered the \"phone\" part of “smartphone” useless. Or at least, very dumb. But help might, finally, be on the way. \nThe Do Not Call list, which debuted in 2004, was perhaps the most popular program operated by the U.S. government in decades — 50 million numbers were entered before the list even took effect. Since then, another 170 million numbers were entered into the registry. U.S. telemarketers quickly learned to abide by the list or face multi-million dollar fines the Federal Trade Commission could impose — and there have been more than 100 enforcement actions . \nIt worked...for a while. But the combination of internet-based telephones and cheap long-distance calls have made it easy for telephone scofflaws to operate overseas, far beyond the reach of U.S. authorities. Unwanted calls have returned with a vengeance, making some wonder if the Do Not Call list works at all. \nHow bad is the problem? A firm called YouMail Inc. tries to count the number of robocalls that pester Americans, and the statistics are staggering. YouMail claims that 2.5 billion unwanted calls were placed just in April 2017, equaling 7.7 calls per person. \nFor fun, YouMail breaks down its data by ZIP code , and found that Atlanta wins for most robocalls received, with about 50 million placed just to the 404 area code in April. Another 35 million arrived at Atlanta’s 678 area code. Houston and Dallas area codes came in second and third. New York City's 917 area code was fifth, with 29 million. \nThe robocall problem has been intractable for a series of reasons — mainly, because it makes the criminals who run scams like fake IRS debt collection like these a lot of money. But two other technology reasons stick out. \nCriminals can “spoof” caller ID numbers. \nFirst, it's become easier for criminals to \"spoof\" caller ID numbers. That not only keeps consumers from blocking numbers, it can also make them more likely to answer. Calls that appear to come from the recipient’s own area code — or even share the same first six digits of their phone number — suggest a local call, so consumers are tempted to answer. \nThe telecom industry has a hard time stopping suspicious calls. \nSecond, the telecom industry has avoided implementing technology that would stop many suspicious calls because the firms claim they are legally required to connect calls, and they don't have the authority to decide what is spam and what isn't. \nYears of frustration and consumer complaints finally nudged the Federal Communications Commission toward action last year, and it created the Robocall Strike Force. In August, tech heavy hitters like AT&T, Google, and Microsoft gathered in Washington, D.C., to discuss ideas. \nThen in March, with the FCC under new leadership, Chairman Ajit Pai indicated he would go ahead with proposals from the task force. Specifically, he would call for a change in rules that explicitly gave telecom firms the right to cut off spammers. \n\"Under my proposal, the FCC would give providers greater leeway to block spoofed robocalls. Specifically, they could block calls that purport to be from unassigned or invalid phone numbers — there’s a database that keeps track of all phone numbers, and many of them aren’t assigned to a voice service provider or aren’t otherwise in use,\" he wrote in a Medium post explaining the change. \"There is no reason why any legitimate caller should be spoofing an unassigned or invalid phone number. It’s just a way for scammers to evade the law.\" \nLater in March, the FCC approved the proposal. The work isn't done, however. There's now a public comment period; a vote to enact the new rules won't happen until later this year. Then there will be a transition period as carriers implement their spoofed-call-blocking technologies. \nHow to stop unwanted spam phone calls \nRelief is in sight, but it's not time to turn your ringtone back on just yet. For now, consumers can investigate third-party services like Nomorobo ($2/month, iPhone only, see a review here ) or Hiya (free, see iTunes reviews here ) that claim to help by using blacklists and other methods to identify spam callers. Some providers and smartphones offer their own free call-blocking options, but they are cumbersome to use. Consumers can Google phone numbers that call, just to see if others have complained online about them. Or simply keep screening those calls for a bit longer. \nMagnifyMoney is a price comparison and financial education website, founded by former bankers who use their knowledge of how the system works to help you save money. \nMagnifyMoney ",

      "text": "Close 10 money-saving foods everyone should keep in their kitchen In a world full of overpriced organic food chains, it's easy to get discouraged about eating healthily. But believe it or not, you don't have to spend a lot of money to eat well. Brynne Conroy / MagnifyMoney , KHOU 11:21 AM. EDT June 15, 2017 \nIn a world full of overpriced organic food chains, it’s easy to get discouraged about eating healthily. But believe it or not, you don’t have to spend a lot of money to eat well. \nHere are ten foods that will help you meet the task without busting your budget. \nFrozen Fruits and Vegetables \nFruits and veggies are a great snack on their own, but you can also use them to make smoothies, supplement a meal, or serve as a main course in dishes like vegetable lasagna or broccoli salad. \nBuying fruits and veggies from the frozen section is much more affordable than fresh. For example, the average retail price for a pound of fresh blueberries is $4.73, while the same amount frozen averages only $3.64. And since you don’t have to worry about them going bad if you don’t eat them right away, the chance of wasting money is slimmer. While it’s true for certain produce that the nutrient composition can change marginally when freezing fruits and vegetables, the difference is negligible , according to a study by researchers at the University of California-Davis. \nYou can’t keep your frozen fare indefinitely, but you can keep it a long time. A University of Georgia study found it typically it takes eight months to a year before nutrients start deteriorating in your freezer, so you’re unlikely to overbuy. \nBrown Rice \nRice is affordable, but because it’s a carb, it’s also very filling. A little goes a long way, with one cup of dry rice feeding a family of four. It’s one of the few readily available carbs that doesn’t contain gluten, making it an affordable alternative to specialty breads and flours for those with sensitivities. \nWhen it comes to carbohydrates, brown is better. In the case of brown rice, it is not as fully refined as white rice. Rice is a seed, and brown rice retains a part of the seed’s hull. This protective layer helps it maintain the nutrients inside the seed so they don’t cook away. \nBrown rice can be enjoyed on its own, but it can also be used as a side or as a main ingredient in a dish. One go-to for an easy meal is a mushroom chicken rice bake. Use 3/4 cup of rice, mix in one can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup water. Throw frozen chicken on top and bake, and you have a full meal — as long as you pull out one of those frozen veggies as a side. \nWhole-Wheat Bread \nWhole-wheat bread is an affordable, multipurpose carb. Use it for sandwiches, and you can add protein with meat or nut butter. Use it for toast in the morning to get your metabolism started for the day. It’s incredibly easy to pair with other foods and is a staple of a frugal pantry. \nBread doesn’t tend to keep well, though. To make sure yours doesn’t get moldy, keep in a dry place at room temperature. That includes keeping it away from heat sources like your fridge or dishwasher. If you’re a serial offender when it comes to bread and food waste, consider freezing half the loaf so it will last longer. \nMuch like brown rice, whole-wheat bread is more nutritious than its white counterpart because of the refining process. \nWhole-Grain Pasta \nWhile the price of pasta has gone up over the past decade, it still makes for an affordable meal. Heavy in carbs, it fills you up quickly, and it can be supplemented by vegetables and marginal amounts of meat soaked in sauce. \nBecause whole-grain pasta is made with whole-wheat flour, it retains a lot more of its vitamins, minerals, and fiber than its “regular” counterpart, which is made with refined flour. \nBeans \nBeans are a nutrient-packed protein and almost always cheaper (and sometimes healthier) than meat. If you want a super-frugal meal, use your beans, rice, and frozen veggies. You’ll have your food pyramid pretty much balanced. \nDry beans are more cost-effective than canned. When you buy canned, you’re not only paying for the weight of the beans — you’re also paying for the liquid they’re submerged in. Canned beans can cost twice as much as dry, but know yourself. If you don't take the time to prepare the dry beans, you won’t reap any of the nutritional benefits. That being said, canned beans are still cheaper than meat, and take a lot less time to prepare. \nRegardless of packaging, you don’t have to eat your beans plain. You can bust out the slow cooker and make some chili. Add them to a soup or salad and suddenly your light fare becomes filling and nutrient-rich. The possibilities are endless. \nFrozen Chicken \nIf you appreciate that beans have protein, but still want to eat meat, those economy-size bags of frozen chicken are an affordable alternative. \nYou can purchase either chicken thighs or chicken breasts. Breasts are marginally healthier. In the past thighs have been dramatically cheaper. In the past decade, though, the price of thighs has caught up to the price of breasts, making the amount you pay at the checkout line virtually identical. Pick whichever tastes best to you. \nWhen making your purchase, be sure to look for chicken that has been “air chilled.” This means that no water was used in the freezing process and that you won’t be paying for the associated ice. Every ounce you’re paying for will be pure chicken. \nChicken can be used in salads or rice bakes, or as the main course itself. It’s extremely versatile, so you will be able to turn it into a meal no matter what else is left in your cabinet. \nEggs \nThe price of eggs can fluctuate greatly. Regardless of these fluctuations, they’re still a great pick for healthy and affordable meals. They provide a lot of protein and serve as a leavening agent in baking. Whether you’re making an omelet or baking a birthday cake so you don’t have to pay over-inflated prices at a bakery, eggs are a staple you’ll need on an ongoing basis. \nEgg producers put a lot of different labels on their packaging to convince you that their product is the healthiest. While it’s true that “cage-free” eggs may be marginally healthier, there’s no organization that oversees this certification. Omega-3 is good for you, but “omega-3 enriched” eggs often have the exact same amount of omega-3 as regular eggs — with quite the markup. \nAs far as actual health benefits go, the only certification that is monitored is “organic.” The USDA audits these egg producers every year, ensuring that their hens are eating food that is free of antibiotics, pesticides, animal byproducts, and GMOs. \nIf you’re going to spend more money on specialty eggs for health reasons, “organic” is the only label you can really trust. \nOatmeal \nMuch like rice, oatmeal is a gluten-free carb that can help you feel full by eating a relatively small amount. It’s also full of minerals that your body needs, unlike the refined carbs found in sugary cereals. \nBecause it keeps you full longer, oatmeal is a common component of many weight-loss diets, but it has other health benefits aside from fighting obesity. The fiber in oatmeal helps regulate cholesterol, aiding heart health. The fiber also helps improve intestinal health. \nThe best way to purchase oats is in a large container. Those small, microwaveable, flavored packets may be convenient, but they’re more expensive and reduce the oats’ versatility. \nYou can make oatmeal for breakfast, adding your own milk and spices, or you can add it to your yogurt for a nutritious morning meal. If you bake your own bread, oats are a great way to add even more nutrition to a whole-wheat loaf, and for those occasions when you indulge in baking desserts, oatmeal adds texture and helps make you feel like you’re doing something a little better for your body than you actually are. \nNut Butters \nNut butters — like almond, cashew, and peanut — are high in protein, keeping you full longer. They’re commonly used in weight-loss diets for this reason, and can also help combat high cholesterol. They can be used in sandwiches or on toast, and can encourage more fruit consumption as nut butters make a phenomenal dip. \nNut butters can be expensive, though. Almond butter has one of the lowest calorie counts, but it also comes with a high price tag. If you’re not loving the price at your regular or specialty grocer, check to see if there’s a food co-op in your area. \nFood co-ops sometimes require membership, but sometimes don’t. They typically provide exclusively healthier foods and have a strong emphasis on organic or locally sourced products. When compared to large chains, their prices tend to be lower, allowing you to get all the benefits of products like nut butter at a lower price. \nCoconut Oil \nOil is a necessary part of any diet, but which oil you choose can greatly impact your health. Pick an oil with too much trans fat, and your cholesterol levels are likely to get out of whack. Pick one with the right mixture of healthy acids, and consumption could actually boost your immune system. \nCoconut oil is a good choice because it has lauric acid — which is known to fight illnesses and boost the immune system. Make sure to purchase a product that has not been partially hydrogenated, though. Hydrogenated oil is a trans fat, and can negate some of the benefits you’re reaping by using coconut oil in the first place. \nDon’t like the taste of coconut? No problem. Refined coconut oil has very little taste and is actually better than the unrefined version when you’re doing stovetop cooking. Unrefined coconut oil has a smoke point of 350 degrees, while refined coconut oil’s smoke point is 450 degrees. This is also higher than the extra virgin olive oil that has long been a staple of the healthy cook’s repertoire. Extra virgin olive oil’s smoke point is 410 degrees , making refined coconut oil the best choice for cooking. \nCoconut oil has become increasingly integrated into mainstream grocery stores, but if you’re still struggling with price, keep an eye out for lower prices while you’re picking up your nut butter at your local co-op. \nMagnifyMoney is a price comparison and financial education website, founded by former bankers who use their knowledge of how the system works to help you save money. \nMagnifyMoney ",

      "text": "Bye-bye boarding pass? TSA, airlines test fingerprints, facial recognition to ID travelers Bart Jansen , USA TODAY , TEGNA 4:19 AM. EDT June 15, 2017 Travelers wait in a TSA Pre line for entering security check at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport November 23, 2016 in Arlington, Virginia. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) (Photo: Alex Wong, 2016 Getty Images) \nThe Transportation Security Administration announced Tuesday that it is testing technology to identify passengers by their fingerprints at airports in Atlanta and Denver — a system that could ultimately eliminate paper boarding passes and ID documents. \nThe experiment comes as TSA studies ways to get travelers through checkpoints faster. \nThe private identification company Clear pioneered a service for travelers to skip to the head of airport checkpoint lines after identifying them by fingerprints or iris scans. Carriers such as JetBlue Airways and Delta Air Lines also want to use the technology to identify passengers. \nTSA is evaluating whether a passenger’s fingerprints could be used reliably to authenticate the person’s identity and boarding pass. The test is for Precheck members, who have already provided fingerprints as part of their application for the expedited screening lanes. \n“TSA looks at technologies and intelligence capabilities that allow us to analyze and secure the travel environment, passengers and their property,” said Steve Karoly, TSA acting assistant administrator for requirements and capabilities analysis. “Through these and other technology demonstrations, we are looking to reinvent and enhance security effectiveness to meet the evolving threat and ensure that passengers get to their destinations safely.” \nClear already offers to identify travelers at 21 airports and let them skip to the head of TSA lines. The program costs $179 per year, although a member's relative costs $50. Delta also reduces the cost for its frequent fliers. \nJetBlue announced May 31 t hat it was collaborating with Customs and Border Protection, another division of the Department of Homeland Security, on facial-recognition technology from SITA to identify travelers at the gate during boarding. \nThe program will begin this summer with flights from Boston’s Logan International Airport to Aruba’s Queen Beatrix International Airport, and customers don't need to enroll or register before participating. Travelers, who don’t need boarding passes, will step up to a camera for a picture that will be compared to CBP’s database for passports, visas and immigration photos. \n“We hope to learn how we can further reduce friction points in the airport experience, with the boarding process being one of the hardest to solve,” said Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue’s executive vice president of customer experience. “Self-boarding eliminates boarding pass scanning and manual passport checks. Just look into the camera and you’re on your way.” \nDelta Air Lines announced Tuesday that passengers departing from Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson and New York’s John F. Kennedy airports will be part of a test of facial-recognition equipment with Customs and Border Protection. The test using equipment from NEC Corp. at Atlanta and Vision-Box at JFK aims to use facial recognition for identification and ticketing. \n“Delta is always willing to partner with the CBP as it continues testing new technologies to improve its processes,” said Gil West, Delta's chief operating officer. \nThe test began Monday at JFK at gate B24 and will begin later this summer at Atlanta’s gates E10 and E12. The airline has been collaborating for a year in Atlanta with NEC and CBP on testing facial-recognition for exit screening at gates F6 and F9. \n\"CBP has been working with our stakeholders to build a simplified but secure travel process that not only meets the biometric exit mandate, but also aligns with CBP’s and the travel industry’s modernization efforts,” said John Wagner, CBP’s deputy executive assistant commissioner for field operations. \nTSA will analyze how the system works for possible expansion to more airports. \n© 2017 USATODAY.COM ",

      "text": "I live on the road—these are 11 tools you should always carry in your car Seamus Bellamy, Reviewed.com , TEGNA 8:10 AM. EDT June 15, 2017 Photo: iggy1965 / Getty Images CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nYour car can lug home your groceries or propel you across the country to enjoy new vistas with old friends. But it can also leave you stranded in the middle of nowhere or worse, injured and trapped in a tangle of glass and steel. There’s no shame in calling for help to get you out of a bind. But, with the right hardware stashed away in your glovebox and trunk, you could save yourself the expense of a roadside assistance call, or even rescue yourself or another motorist. \nNot sure of where to start? We’ve got your back. We spent days testing these 11 pieces of hardware and found them be not only reliable, but easy to use. 1. Reusable flares to prevent collisions \nRoad flares are great for ensuring that you get the amount of visibility you need to stay safe at the side of the road. But when you light up a single-use magnesium flare, you’re throwing away money and risking your eyebrows. After testing them against OG magnesium flares, we found Wagan’s reusable EL2639 LED flares are a smarter option. They’re bright, can run for up to 38 hours off of three AAA batteries, rugged, and waterproof. You can buy them individually or in a pack of three. 2. Cut-resistant gloves that can handle broken glass \nChanging a flat or, should it come to it, breaking a car window to escape to safety, won’t do your delicate meathooks any favors. A pair of Mechanic Original CR5A3 Cut Resistant Gloves will help keep you from denting your digits. The palms and fingers of the gloves are lined with Armortex—a cut-resistant material that’ll keep you safe from most sharp surfaces. Despite the protection they afford, we found that these gloves still offer the dexterity you’ll need in order to repair your vehicle or extricate yourself and others from a wreck. Plus, their high visibility color pattern will help other drivers to see you while you’re working at the side of the road. 3. A headlamp to keep your hands free while you work \nChances are, if you’ve got a roadside emergency to contend with, you’ll want both hands free. Keeping a good headlamp in your glovebox is the ideal solution. The Nite Ize STS Headlamp’s bright white LED light (or red, if you’re into preserving your night vision,) is bright enough to illuminate almost any task. And, as it can run off the included rechargeable battery pack or 3 AAA batteries, it’s easy to keep juiced up and ready to go. 4. A way to call for help in cellular dead zones \nIf you run into car trouble in an area without cellphone coverage, the SPOT GEN3 GPS Messenger (service plan required) could save your bacon. \nFor as little as an additional $30 per year above the cost of the GEN3’s base service plan, you’ll gain access to SPOT’s Save Our Vehicle (S.O.V.) roadside assistance plan. Simply step out of your vehicle and push a button on the GEN3 and the device will communicate with a network of satellites to bring local help rescue. \nSubscribers are rewarded well for their investment: up to five free tows per year, assistance in getting your ride out of the ditch and back on the road, emergency tire and battery service, delivery of oil or gas, and help if you locked yourself out of your car. Did we mention that you can also use the Messenger to let your family know you’re OK or call for help when you’re on a hike in the woods? Because it can totally do that too. \nI've owned and carried one of these for over a year now and have never regretted the investment. 5. A jumpstart for any size battery \nThe NOCO GB150 is a 4,000-amp lithium-ion battery that will jumpstart anything from a Pinto to a Peterbilt, up to as large as a 10-liter gas or diesel engine—that covers pretty much every car on the road. \nIt boasts spark-proof connectors and reverse polarity protection, a 500-lumen work light, and USB charging capabilities. There's also a voltmeter to help you to understand whether your battery is the cause of your car troubles or if calling for professional help is the way to go. All this in a package about the same size as a lunchbox. \nYou can buy smaller NOCO batteries, but we feel having a high-capacity battery is the way to go—if you buy a larger vehicle, RV, or even a boat, you'll have the hardware on hand you need to jump its battery back to life. 6. An insanely easy way to fix a flat tire \nNo one wants to change a flat tire at the side of the road (except maybe a tow truck driver.) The 12-volt powered Fix-A-Flat Ultimate makes doing it a thing of the past. Connect it to a flat tire’s valve stem and within seconds the tire will begin to fill with chemical sealing agent to temporarily mend your tire and air to re-inflate it. In under 10 minutes, you’ll be back on the road and on your way to a service station. \nFlipping a button instead of messing with a jack and spare? What's not to love about that? 7. A tool to cut the seatbelt and smash the window that fits on your keyring \nIf you’ve been in a car accident, you’re already having a bad day. Don’t let it get worse by having no choice but to stay trapped inside of your vehicle until help arrives. The Resqme, made by the company of the same name, is small enough to keep on your keychain and useful enough to earn its place there. It comes with a blade designed to safely slash through a nylon seatbelt without harming you or your passengers in the process. Once free of your seatbelt, you can then use the Resqme’s pressure-activated glass breaker to smash a window out of your car so that you can walk or, if needs be, swim to safety. \nHaving tested the Resqme on multiple windows at a local wrecking yard, I can tell you that using it couldn't be easier. 8. An everyday carry tool with car safety in mind \nMost of the tools in this guide are designed to live in your glovebox or trunk until you need them. The Spyderco Assist is designed to live in your pocket until others new you. The integrated glass breaker in its handle could come in handy for helping the victim of an accident out of a dangerous wreck, and its safety-tipped serrated blade slices through seatbelt material like butter. As you'll be able to find a million other uses for it in your life, carrying it around with you won't feel like a burden. \nOr, if the Assist’s price is too rich for your blood, check out the Leatherman Z-REX. While we found that it doesn't have the utility to be as useful in day-to-day life as a regular knife might, it costs significantly less than a Spyderco blade, but can do the same amount of hurt to seatbelts and automotive glass. 9. Crazy strong, crazy bright tape \nA roadside repair doesn’t have to be pretty—it just has to get you home. When the time comes to make an ugly, but effective repair, few tools are more useful to have on hand than a roll of duct tape. We like Gorilla brand Duct tape as its wide, water-resistant and with its extra-thick adhesive backing, it can stick to most any surface. \nPro tip: A roll of high-visibility orange is great for taping the word ‘help’ into you vehicle’s window to flag down other motorists. 10. An emergency blanket/tarp to keep you warm or patch a missing window \nWhether you’re using it to keep warm while you wait for help to arrive, or patching up a broken window, you’ll be glad to have the SOL Heavy Duty Emergency Blanket in the back of your car. Despite weighing just under eight ounces, it’s surprisingly tough, large enough to almost entirely hide that shameful chunk of metal you call a car, and is both wind and waterproof. As it’s 90% heat reflective, it also makes a great beach shelter in a pinch. 11. A legit first aid kit \nHeaded out on a road trip? Depending on your intake of gas station nachos, you could wind up spending more time in bathrooms than in your car. The Mountain Backpacker first-aid kit has everything in it to mend your trouble tummy and more. \nDespite its mountain climbing moniker, this first-aid kit is perfect for providing medical care to road trippers, car campers, or those with light injuries. It contains everything you’ll need to tend to minor wounds, burns, and sprains. It also comes with single-dose medicines to treat allergic reactions, diarrhea, pain, fever, and inflammation. \nNo first aid training? No problem: The kit includes flashcards and a first-aid handbook will help you muddle through the treatment of a wide assortment of boo-boos. I trust Adventure Medical Kits enough in my personal life to keep one in my home and one in my car—recommending one to you is an obvious choice. \nOur editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.

EDT June 15, 2017 Chesapeake McDonald's under fire after American Flag seen on ground. (Photo: 13News Now viewer) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nCHESAPEAKE, Va. (WVEC) – A picture of an American flag touching the ground is gaining attention on Facebook. \nA man who wanted to remain anonymous told 13News Now he was driving past the McDonald’s, located on Portsmouth Blvd, when he saw an employee putting up a new flag, but the old flag was on the ground—violating the United States flag code. He snapped a picture and posted it on social media—urging McDonald’s to address the issue. 13News Now asked people in the area what they thought of the incident. Some said it was downright disrespectful. Other were more forgiving. \n“It never should come into contact with the ground like that. It disappoints me if anything,” Jacob Inman said. \n“My husband was in the military so I know all about it. It’s just about respect for the country and respect for the people who serve our country. It’s disrespectful,” one woman said.“He has two hands and it’ a very large flag. How many young people are you gonna ask today about proper flag protocol and they’re gonna give you a correct answer? Probably not very many,” Christy Burke said. McDonald’s management responded to the incident telling 13News Now that a crew member draped the flag over his shoulder, and it accidentally fell to the ground. A spokesperson said it was completely unintentional and management is planning to provide a flag procedures training refresher to all staff later this week. \nJS&J Restaurants, Inc., the local McDonald’s franchise organization that owns the restaurant released this official statement Wednesday: \n“We take great pride in the American Flag and regret any offense taken as a result of this accidental error. We take this matter very seriously and have reinforced proper flag raising protocol with employees.” \n© 2017 WVEC-TV ",

      "text": "\nPhil Mickelson has withdrawn from the U.S. Open, realizing there was no chance to get from his daughter's high school graduation in California to make his tee time in Wisconsin. Editor's Picks No, Mickelson's quest for elusive U.S. Open didn't just die \nJust because Phil Mickelson's U.S. Open chase is on hiatus this year doesn't mean he's never going to win the only major that has eluded him. \nThis is the first time Mickelson has missed the U.S. Open since he failed to qualify in 1993 and his first missed major since the 2009 Open. \nMickelson had been holding out hope that, with the potential of storms over Wisconsin, there might be a four-hour delay that would allow him to watch his daughter graduate and zoom across the country in his private jet. His daughter Amanda is senior class president at Pacific Ridge School in Carlsbad, California, and is scheduled to give a commencement speech. \nInstead, the U.S. Open began Thursday under sunshine with little threat of bad weather all day. \nRoberto Diaz of Mexico, the next alternate, officially took Mickelson's afternoon tee time. \nMickelson holds the U.S. Open record with six runner-up finishes, and it's the only major keeping him from the career Grand Slam. \n\"It's a tournament that I want to win the most,\" Mickelson said two weeks ago when he first revealed the scheduling conflict. \"The only way to win is if you play and have a chance. But this is one of those moments where you look back on life and you just don't want to miss it. I'll be really glad that I was there and present.\" Phil Mickelson's quest for an elusive U.S. Open victory is off for 2017, as he officially withdrew from the tournament Thursday morning. Andrew Redington/Getty Images \nAmanda nearly caused Mickelson to withdraw from the 1999 U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2. Mickelson's wife, Amy, was due with her as the tournament opened. Mickelson carried a beeper with him and pledged to leave in the middle of the tournament, if necessary -- even if he were leading. Payne Stewart made a 15-foot par putt on the last hole to beat Mickelson by one shot. \nAmanda was born the next day. \nThe last time Mickelson finished second at the U.S. Open was in Merion in 2013, the week Amanda graduated from the eighth grade. Mickelson attended that ceremony too, though it was on a Wednesday. He flew overnight to Philadelphia, arrived at 4 a.m. and took a quick nap before his 7:11 a.m. tee time. He took the 54-hole lead that week until Justin Rose surged past him on the back nine. \nMickelson, who celebrates his 47th birthday Friday, said he believes he will have more chances at that elusive U.S. Open trophy, and the next few years are favorable. The U.S. Open will be played next year at Shinnecock Hills, where Mickelson was in position to win in 1995 and 2004. Then it's Pebble Beach in 2019 and Winged Foot in 2020. Winged Foot is where he made a double-bogey on the final hole to lose by 1 stroke. \nESPN Stats & Information and The Associated Press contributed to this report. ",

      "text": "Joe Blundo @joeblundo\nColumbus established the nation’s first junior high school in 1909 — I think.\nOther people have thought otherwise.\nOhio State University announced last week that it would pursue buying the old Indianola Junior High School building, at 420 E. 19th Ave.\nIndianola, established in 1909 in a different building, is often referred to as the first junior high in the nation.\nI have written so myself, thinking that it is an undisputed fact. Well, it might be a fact, but it’s not undisputed.\nJunior highs in Berkeley, California; Lincoln, Nebraska; and Richmond, Indiana, have also been proclaimed the first, as I discovered by searching Google Books.\nBeing first was a big deal back when the junior high was hailed as an innovative way to battle high dropout rates. Later, it was supplanted by the middle school.\nBerkeley’s Willard Junior High School has often been called the first. The Pennsylvania School Journal of 1920 declared that Berkeley was widely known as “the mother of the junior high.”\nBut Willard opened in 1910, which would put it a year after the original Indianola Junior High opened at 140 E. 16th Avenue. Even The PTA at what is now called Willard Middle School concedes that.\n“Long thought to be the first junior high school in the United States, . . . Willard was in fact the first in California, and the first junior high school west of the Mississippi,” its website says. Columbus was first, it says.\nSome Nebraskans think the “first” designation belongs to Whittier Junior High School, built in 1923; in 2010, the Lincoln Journal Star called it the “first building in the United States constructed specifically for a junior high school.\"\nI suppose it depends on how “junior high” is defined, but Indianola opened in 1909 to educate students in grades 7, 8 and 9, which sounds like a junior high to me.\nRichmond, though, might have the earliest claim on the title.\n“Richmond pioneered the junior high school in the late 1890s, and, by 1900, the Garfield Junior High was a smoothly functioning component,” said a paper presented in 1991 at the Society for the Study of Curriculum History.\nBut a 1922 article in the American School Board Journal by the former Richmond schools superintendent says Richmond “began to develop” a junior high in 1895 in a building that accommodated other age groups, too. There was a separate junior high building by 1910.\nAlexander Inglis, an education expert from the early 20th century, was Quote: d in a 1921 doctoral dissertation as saying that “the real beginning of the present junior high school” can be traced to several cities.\nFirst on his list: Columbus, Ohio.\nLet’s go with that.\n ",

(Source: CNN) \nBEIJING (AP) - Seven people were killed and 59 injured in an explosion Thursday at the front gate of a kindergarten in eastern China as relatives were picking up their children at the end of the school day, local officials said. \nThe blast at the Chuangxin Kindergarten in Fengxian, which struck at 4:50 p.m., was under investigation, the Xuzhou city government in Jiangsu province said on its microblog. \nIt wasn't immediately clear whether the explosion was deliberately set or the result of an accident. \nThe official newspaper Global Times reported on its website that the incident was caused by the explosion of a gas cylinder at a roadside food stall, citing a witness identified only by the surname Shi. The blast sent people flying several meters (yards) into the air, Shi was quoted as saying. \nKindergartens in China have been targeted before in apparent revenge attacks carried out by mentally ill people or those bearing grudges against their neighbors and society. \nVideos purportedly from the scene and posted on social media showed children and adults lying on the ground, some bleeding. Clothing, shoes and other items were strewn on the ground beside pools of blood. The videos showed ambulances arriving and medics wheeling people into an emergency room. \nThe Xuzhou government said two people died at the scene and five others died at a hospital. At least four others were seriously injured, it said. \nCalls to the kindergarten and local hospitals rang unanswered. \nIn 2010, nearly 20 children were killed in attacks on schools, prompting a response from top government officials and leading many schools to beef up security with the posting of guards and the installation of gates and other barriers. Last year, a knife-wielding assailant injured seven students outside a primary school in a northern city. \nChina maintains tight control over firearms and most attacks are carried out using knives, axes or homemade explosives.

      "text": "2017 \nFrenchman prevails on Wednesday \nIt’s rare enough to win a match after saving match point, but Lucas Pouille did this in truly thrilling fashion against Jan-Lennard Struff on Wednesday at the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart. \nPouille squandered two match points trying to serve out the contest at 6-5 in the deciding set, and another pair at 6/5 and 7/6 in the final-set tie-break. With Struff serving at 8/7, the Frenchman tracked down a brilliant drop shot and then flicked back two reflex volleys. He was so close to the net that he had to be careful not to break the plane of it, but the second volley was a clean winner that brought the crowd to their feet. \nPouille used that momentum to power through the next two points and prevail 4-6, 7-6(5), 7-6(8). The fourth seed will look for a far less dramatic match in the quarter-finals when he plays local favourite Philipp Kohlschreiber . ",

      "text": "49ers Injury News Kyle Shanahan talks about what he’s learned through first few months, dealing with injuries, more The 49ers head coach had plenty to discuss as the 49ers wrapped up their final minicamp practice. We have a full transcript, courtesy of 49ers PR. Watch video here . Rec How do you think practice went yesterday? What did you like out there? “I thought it was good. I thought we battled both sides of the ball. I didn’t think either side really did better than the other. I thought we started off good with the offense. I think defense came back real strong in the red zone and I thought the offense just edged it out and moved the ball, period. A lot of things we got better at and a lot of things we’ve still got to clean up.” Your dad’s been here the couple times we’ve seen. Obviously, he’s an observer. Is he, do you guys talk in shop much afterwards? “No, we just talk about movies.” Is that right? “No, I’m just joking. I’m not sure we talk about much other than football, because we enjoy it a lot. He loves football and he likes to be in a place where he can watch everything. He’ll have an office attached to my office, so he just posts up in there and watches a lot of tape and comes out with ideas a lot and saying stuff. It’s good to have as many eyes as possible looking at stuff. Especially on people that you think are talented at what they do and people you trust their opinions. I use any advice I can get from anyone.” Do you consider him part of your staff? “No. It’s, I think, he’s enjoying life right now. He’s got a pretty good deal in Denver and where he lives. He can help me out in other ways anyways without having to be here every day.” What areas, just a few months into this job, have you leaned on him so far and try to see, have there been any situations where you go to him for counsel? “No. You know, it’s been going so fast you don’t have that much time always for phone conversations. It’s real nice when as a first time head coach, trying to do the whole offensive thing and do all the head coach stuff too, you’re going 1,000 miles an hour. Sometimes to see everything you’ve got to really slow things down and take your time to look at stuff and you don’t always have that time as a head coach. It’s nice when someone you know who thinks similar to you has a similar background and he just sits in a room all day and watches stuff. He doesn’t have any other responsibilities. He can see some things that I’m not always seeing and just to bring things to light that maybe I missed or other people have missed. The more people you have who know what you’re trying to do, watch stuff, there’s always something to find. That’s why all of us kind of go crazy with never feeling like we’re done. There’s something else to look at. The more you can get people in that situation, it’s only a benefit.” Talk about going 1,000 miles an hour, you’ve basically been doing that since training camp with the Falcons last July. So, what do you do these next few weeks? “I try to check out, personally. It’s been a while. Usually I get a couple weeks after the season. It was different this year for obvious reasons. It, I feel like I’ve recovered. I’m good now, but it will be nice to get away for an extended period of time. Usually I go to Mexico for a few weeks with my family and don’t wear a watch around, don’t look at anything, just wake up when I wake up, go to sleep whenever I’m tired and just to hang out with the kids and try to be pretty anxiety free because I know it’s the calm before the storm usually.” You had a couple big plays yesterday offensively using play-action. How important is that overall to your offensive philosophy? “I think it’s very important. It’s just, you want to put defenses in a bind and you want to make them start, stop certain things. If you want to run the ball, you want to make them stop the run game and schematically how are they going to stop that. There’s certain ways you put teams in a bind and you make them stop the run and then you know you have the play-action or you have a bootleg or something like that. There’s just ways to take pressure off the O-Line, pressure off the quarterbacks. It helps you get some easier explosive plays, not just dropping back all the time and needing your quarterback to just be unbelievable and the protection and everything. I think it allows you to get a lot of explosive plays without pressure on people and keeps the defense honest, which is the most important thing.” S Eric Reid said the toughest thing about going against your offense was being able to discern a running play versus play-action. Is that the most important thing for you when you’re coaching that up? “I mean, I think it is if you’re not just dialing up plays. You want to know why they’re stopping something and if they do, schematically there’s some hole that they’re leaving. If that’s the case, you know what you’re going to get if you make it look the exact same and if it looks the exact same and that guy does what he does to make a zero-yard run, but he also has to get under a 15-yard route, that puts that guy in a bind. If he’s stopping the run, it’s going to help out the receiver and the quarterback. If he’s not stopping the run because he’s so worried about the receiver and quarterback, now you’re getting four yards before that guy shows up. It makes people hesitate. If you let a defense tee off in this league, I don’t care who it is or who you are on offense, they’re usually going to get after you once you become one dimensional.” I think one of the explosive plays was WR Marquise Goodwin sprinting down the right side. He came in notoriously fast. How fast has he looked to you and how’s he coming along? “He’s coming along well. He’s been fun to work with. I’ve watched Marquise since he was at Texas. He’s a guy I was really interested in coming out of college and just watching him at Buffalo the past last few years. I mean, everyone knows how fast he can run. When you can run that fast it’s scary for defenses, they have to back up. What makes Marquise unique is he can break down also. So, when you can run real fast and scare everyone, but you can also break down, it helps you get open because guys are scared of the touchdown. And once they start squatting on you, you have a chance to run by them and get an explosive. You do that once every few weeks and you’re probably not going to get it again, but it’s going to be a lot easier to move the chains because everyone is so scared of what he could do. That’s what speed does. You’ve got to work at it to get those deep ones, whether they work or they don’t, just the fact that you’re willing to do it usually puts pressure on a defense, makes them defend the whole field.” You’ve had him now, it seemed like he was kind of limited in what they asked him to do with Buffalo. Are you trying to figure out exactly how you can use him, what variation of routes he can run? “Yeah, always. You try put guys, you try to give guys the best chance to be successful and then it’s up to them once you put them in that situation. And so, you want to find guy’s skillsets, what they do the best. He obviously runs real fast, so you want to move him deep, but guys who run real fast, if they only go deep, they’re very easy to cover, people who just run deep. If you threaten them with deep stuff, you can put him on a lot of other routes that also get him open. That’s what’s been fun with Marquise, because you haven’t seen a lot of it on tape. He’s been pretty much outside the numbers his whole career, even in college. Now to move him all over, it’s new for him, its trial and error, but what I like about Marquise is he’s not embarrassed if he’s not used to something. He goes out there, puts it all out there. He’s not scared to fail. He tries his hardest, and routes that he wasn’t very good at on OTA one he’s much different now. You just want to keep putting him in those situations, challenge him and by the time you get to the season, you’ve kind of got an idea of what he does real good, what he doesn’t and you mash it up with the rest of your group.” Another one of the big plays yesterday was to TE George Kittle. Is he showing you what you hoped to see so far? “Yeah, I think George is, like everyone, but George is coming, really battling. He’s competed in the run and the pass game. George is a guy you can tell he is going for it, because the way he competes on the field, which you guys have seen at the times you’ve been out there. Mainly, what he does off the field too. He’s really trying to learn it and that’s given him a chance to show up a little bit.” For training camp, do you want it more physical or do you want the guys to not get hurt? Do you want them to go, not through the motions, you have some competitions going on, but you’ve been part of different styles, your take on training camp? “I want it to be physical. It’s just a standard, how you practice. I don’t plan on us tackling very much, but you’ve got to thud up. You’ve got to hit people. You’ve got to square people up. People don’t ever need to take people to the ground, in my opinion. They can show us that on game day. If you don’t know how to take someone to the ground in the NFL, it’s going to be tough to just learn that in practice also. You’re at the NFL, you better know how to tackle or you’re not going to be there long. But, we want to be physical. We want to go fast. When we get these shoulder pads on, it’s more the run game, the protections, everything is physical as can be without taking your feet off the ground, and going after guys and taking people to the ground tackling. You’ve got to do it then, because you don’t have that option throughout the season. So, you can’t do it in OTAs, if you skip it in training camp, you’re only allowed a certain amount of padded practices and your guys are sore anyways, so I don’t want to do more than what’s allowed.” So, if guys get nicked up will you change the tone of it or you’re just trying to get guys in shape? “Guys better come to camp in shape. It’s not like it used to be. It’s not like there’s five and half weeks and you take the first two weeks just to break them down and get them into football shape. After two weeks, camp’s almost over. You’re getting into that third preseason game, which is like a game and then the fourth game is like three days later. And, a lot of those guys aren’t even on the team after that fourth game. Camp goes fast and the days of coming to camp and easing yourself into shape, usually that person pulls a hamstring, misses two weeks, tries to come back at the end of camp and is playing catchup the rest of the year and everyone wants to know why he had a bad year. So, if you don’t come to camp ready to go, you’re going to get worse not better.” As far as your dad, do you anticipate him also being here around training camp and the regular season here and there? “No, I wouldn’t think the regular season. I would anticipate he’ll come for camp, just because he enjoys it. I’m sure he’ll come down for practice a week or so, whatever it is.” Did you give him an iPad to look at everything? “He has his own iPad. It’s huge, he lives on it. He’s always watching it, so he’s been good.” You’ve got three straight road games and the last two are, what is it, Indy and Washington? Have you determined, are you just going to come home after the Indy game or do you know? “I think we’re coming right home after the Indy game. Do we know? We’ve talked about this. I kind of focus on what’s important now. It’s a little bit, it’ll work out, but I don’t want to be on the road too long personally. It’s our first year together. I think being gone too long, we’re up here a lot. Not just coaches, but players also. Anytime you’re on the road real long, sometimes you go 14 days without seeing your family. I think that can wear on everyone. So, I try to avoid that as much as possible.” Have you guys taken LB Reuben Foster in for any updates, MRIs, or anything? “No, there haven’t been any updates. It’s been the status quo. He’s been doing great with his rehab. I really have no concerns. I think he’ll be more than ready to go by training camp. That’s my feeling. I can’t promise that, but I’d be surprised if it wasn’t.” You expect him to be first day pads, go on, and he would be ready? “Yes, I do. Yes.” TE Garrett Celek had a nice reception yesterday between two defenders. Can you talk about him? “Yeah, we have some good competition there. We have six guys who I believe are all NFL players. Very rarely just six guys on our roster, if ever. So, we’ve got some good competition there. It’s going to be tough for the coaches, but it’s definitely a good problem to have. Speaking of Celek, he’s done a great job. I’ve been a fan of him throughout his career. I remember studying him a couple years ago when I thought he was going to be a free agent. I think it was last year, but they ended up signing him before he went to the market. He’s learning new stuff just like everyone else is, but that whole group in general is doing a real good job.” You were a big fan of WR Trent Taylor. How has he come along? Has he been everything you had hoped so far? “Yeah, Trent is a competitive guy. He gets after it. He's very good at separating. Like all of the rookies right now, everything has been thrown at him. He's had some really good days and he’s had some days where he's been off. I'm really excited about Trent. I'm excited for him to soak all of this in, get away for a little bit and I think he'll come back to training camp and get some good competition out there.” Last training camp one from me, would you ever consider moving it somewhere away from the facility? Have you been a part of that? “Yeah, I've done it both ways. I think there are pluses and minuses to both. I definitely would consider it. Sometimes it's a pain, but sometimes it's nice to get away. I think it kind of makes your group tighter and makes it a little bit less distractions. One thing that is tough about always staying in the same spot is when camp breaks after a few weeks, or whatever it is, it breaks and everyone gets excited, but then you're back in the exact same spot the next morning at the exact same time. You start to realize there is no camp. We just are here. That makes the whole season a little longer. Sometimes it's nice to go away and when it breaks you drive back home. It breaks up the monotony of it and you kind of get a different feel. I like both things. You always get stressed with how are we going to travel everything? Are we going to be used to the situation? There are pluses and minuses for both.” Speaking of breaking up the monotony, is that why those joint practices, or one of the reasons the joint practices are so important? “Yeah. I'm extremely excited about that. I think, for two reasons. One, is that it breaks up the monotony and, two, it allows to go against different looks. We have a scheme that plays a lot of cover-three. Personally, you get bored going against it every single play. That doesn't mean you just want the defense to start making stuff up to help you on offense. One way that you can do that is practicing against other people. You see a few days of different coverages, different fronts, which will help prepare you for the season. I think that's almost more important than a preseason game.” With all of the rotating you're doing along the offensive line, is it difficult to project those guys given that there aren't pads and you're sort of limited with what you can do physically? “To a degree. Definitely in protection. I think protection is one of the toughest things. It's very tough to block defensive linemen in general. It's very tough to block them without pads on and stuff, that makes them a lot more slippery. And the run game, it's give and take. It depends on what type of fronts they're playing and what type of techniques. One good thing about that outside-zone is you're not pulling guards and stuff very much so there's very rarely this [pounding fists together] and it's usually on somewhat of an angle, which I feel like we can get away practicing a little more runs than most people do. It's not just with the O-Line, it's with everyone. That's why you never try to get too into anything in OTAs. You'll find out when the pads come on with everyone.” Have you seen this team get tighter over the last couple of months? “Yeah, I have. I have been really impressed with our guys. That's something that was really important to me when I got here. I thought it would take a long time. I think I was kind of saying it yesterday, but I really like the environment here with the players. They seem like a close group. The guys hang out here a lot with each other. I hear them talking about stuff on the weekends together. From what I’ve seen without being here last year and stuff, but I feel we have gotten closer each day since the offseason started.” Last week, at the State of the Franchise stuff LB NaVorro Bowman let it be known that T Joe Staley won an award for the offseason conditioning, training or whatever it was. Can you specify what that was and whether any other awards have been given out for offseason? “I honestly don't even know about the award. I'm sure [strength & conditioning coach] Ray [Wright] gave him something silly to make fun of him in the training room and embarrass him. That's what I'm guessing, but Joe is everything that I think you guys know he is. Joe is here every day, goes as hard as he can physically and mentally, and he has been really fun to work with.” You’re still relatively early into being a head coach, but in the first couple of months, are there things that have become easier or more comfortable or surprises? “I think there are many parts about it that are easier and there are a lot of parts that are tougher. You definitely can get watered down with more responsibilities if you don't select people to help you in certain areas. If you're not organized with your time, the day can get away from you very quickly. That’s happened to me a lot at the beginning where I came in and I’m expecting to start tape at seven in the morning and it's five o'clockin the afternoon and I haven't turned on the tape yet and then I'm stressing and I'm like, 'What just happened?' Stuff just keeps coming, but I have gotten more used to that. The easier things are that you don't have to worry about as much as you do as a position coach or a coordinator. There are a lot of things that are out of your control when you're those and you can't really solve as many problems. You’ve just got to kind of internalize it and deal with it. It's nice being in the situation of a head coach and being able to work with [general manager] John Lynch and [CEO] Jed [York] and stuff and know whenever there is a problem that you don't have sit there and just internalize it. You can go solve problems and work on things to make things better and decide what's not that big of a problem. I think that stuff makes just coming to work easier and more fun.” With CB Rashard Robinson and LB Ahmad Brooks missing practice, you have praised them recently for what they've been able to do within the defense. Is giving them time off sort of, I don't want to say a reward or you're comfortable with where they are at, but is it kind of telling that these guys have played well and we just want to make sure they're healthy going into camp and this extended off period? “I think it's more about trust. With Ahmad and Rashard, we're not just giving them off because we're throwing them a bone. We're giving them off because they're tight. They're not hurt really bad, but stuff is bothering them. It's the last week before we take a month off. When someone is like that and they've been working every day and doing everything you ask and you don't ever see them being lazy, you trust their intentions are to be out there. When people tell you that they're hurting, you want to listen to that. You don't want someone to tell you that and say, 'Just fight through it,' and then one of them pull a hamstring. Then they spend their next month rehabbing their hamstring and then they come to training camp and they're out of shape. Then they really hurt their hamstring again and it's a chain reaction, which is why they end up having a bad year. Those guys have done everything I’ve asked. They've been here 100-percent. They worked hard in phase two, they worked hard in OTAs and they both have gotten nicked up. We don't want to risk injuring them.”",

      "text": "Rec The Los Angeles Rams have decided to move on from offensive tackle Greg Robinson after only two seasons. The team traded Robinson to the Detroit Lions for a 2018 sixth round pick. The Rams spent the second overall pick on Robinson in the 2014 NFL Draft . He played left tackle and struggled mightily his first two seasons. This offseason, the Rams signed Andrew Whitworth to take over at left tackle. Robinson was moved into a competition with Rob Havenstein at right guard and right tackle, but by OTAs, Jamon Brown had supplanted Robinson on the depth chart. The Rams held on to Robinson two years longer than the San Francisco 49ers held on to A.J. Jenkins after the 2012 NFL Draft. Jenkins was the No. 30 pick and after one season with the 49ers was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for Jon Baldwin. Robinson is the bigger bust in the sense that I believe he was a significantly safer pick when the Rams grabbed him at No. 2. The 49ers surprised most everybody when they drafted Jenkins at No. 30. The Rams offensive line has been a big problem, and heading into Jared Goff’s second season, it remains a big problem. Whitworth is an improvement, but they did not do much else, and are hoping new offensive line coach Aaron Kromer can help boost the underperforming group.",

      "text": "  On Gardening: Coleus worth its weight in gold for summer landscape By NORMAN WINTER Tribune News Service   \nThis time of the year it seems coleus is worth its weight in gold in the landscape offering a persevering performance and flaming color all summer, making it among the best buys for your gardening dollar. \nThe past few years, I touted the big-leafed selections like Inferno, Campfire or Mariposa but to be honest, the narrow-leafed varieties can offer a dazzling performance that you just might have overlooked. One that recently caught my eye was Luminesce from the Stained Glassworks Series. \nI have loved several in this series, but Luminesce is something special with an almost psychedelic iridescence of hot pink. It will reach 20 inches tall and nearly as wide. Partner it with lime green or chartreuse from plants like Wasabi coleus or Goldilocks Lysimachia, and you'll have a combo you can count on for the long summer ahead. Keep your eyes open for Pink Chaos that has a similar look. \nSalsa Verde would also make an incredible partner. This variety made its debut in 2015; the narrow-leafed selection gives you a similar usage in the landscape as perhaps a Gold Mound duranta or a Joseph's coat. \nThe Salsa Verde is part of the Flame Thrower series of coleus coming from Ball FloraPlant which also feature other selections like Spiced Curry, Chili Pepper, and Chipolte. All of these are doing well in trials. In one of the Southeastern trials, Salsa Verde was partnered with Ping Pong Purple gomphrena for a picture perfect display. \nThe plants are from Tropical Africa and Asia and, they were known botanically as Coleus blumei; then a decade or so ago they were switched to the tongue twister Solenostemon scutellarioides. Obviously, that was also a challenge to spell. Now, the new name is Plectranthrus scutellarioides. \nAs tough and great the coleus is, planting in tight, compacted clay will yield less than a satisfactory result. Both the trial beds and the commercial plantings where these-narrow-leafed coleus have been so stunning made great use of prepared landscape mixes that allowed the coleus to reach its true beauty and potential. \nAt the Coastal Georgia Botanical Gardens, we continually work on soil improvement with the addition of compost in any form we can get. If you have tight, heavy clay, or what we call muck, then you will want to work on improving your soil condition, too. Your coleus will thrive, and your thumb will turn an even brighter shade green if you prepare the soil. \nWhat I mean by soil preparation is to loosen it up with organic matter like compost, humus or peat. Work the soil to a depth of 6- to- 8 inches. After planting, be sure to apply a good layer of mulch to conserve moisture. \nAbout a month after transplanting, feed with a light application of a slow released fertilizer and again in mid-summer. We are growing coleus for the fabulous foliage so once flower buds start to form, pinch them off. Just remember that the coleus represents some of the best choices in annual landscape color. The summer is just getting started, and you have a lot of opportunities to use coleus in mixed containers and the landscape as well. Plant coleus with coleus and coleus with flowers and you'll have an award-winning design. \n(Norman Winter is director of the Coastal Georgia Botanical Gardens at the Historic Bamboo Farm, University of Georgia Cooperative Extension, and author of \"Tough-as-Nails Flowers for the South\" and \"Captivating Combinations: Color and Style in the Garden.\" Follow him at: @CGBGgardenguru.)

      "text": "  How to buy the right vacuum cleaner for you By DEBBIE CARLSON Chicago Tribune   \nVacuuming is already a chore, so when the cleaner leaves behind debris, it's frustrating. \nThe problem might not be the vacuum cleaner, but what you're asking it to do. For better results, manufacturers and dealers say buyers need to keep just a few factors in mind. \nFirst consider the home's floor type. Wood and tile floor care is different than wall-to-wall carpeting, which is different still from fine area rugs, said Mark Davis, president of CityHome Vacuums in Chicago, who sells multiple brands. That's why a vacuum that does a great job for a friend might not perform as well in your home. \n\"A lot of people get distracted by various features/benefits without considering if those features/benefits solve their particular cleaning problems,\" said Rob Green, senior design engineer at Dyson. \nJulien Levesque, senior product marketing manager at Shark, said shoppers need to consider two main points: what's being cleaned and home type. A homeowner with a large suburban abode who wants deep cleanings, needs a different cleaner than a city dweller living in a condo who spot cleans daily. \nDavis and Robert Singer, owner of Chicago vacuum dealer Avalon Vacuum said the easiest material to clean is wall-to-wall carpeting, as most upright vacuums are designed for these floors. \n\"Nothing is going to damage it. ... An upright vacuum with a rotating electric brush will be fine. It's just a matter of personal choice and price point,\" Davis said. \nBoth Singer and Davis, who also repair vacuums, say inexpensive vacuums have improved over the years, although they aren't designed to last long. In the budget category, Davis recommends Bissell machines, which start around $70. \nHomeowners with area rugs and hardwood should seek machines that can handle both surfaces, the sources said, and use the right setting for the right floor type to avoid damage. \nFor example, Shark's DuoClean (starting at $155 for the Rocket version, www.sharkclean.com) has a soft brush roller and a bristle brush for wood and carpet. \nGreen said damage – especially to rugs – usually comes from brush bar bristles agitating the rug too aggressively. Singer recommends setting the vacuum's height level at maximum since that allows the bristles to move the fibers and allows the suction to pull out the dirt. \n\"Too low, and it will cut off your air flow,\" he said, and could harm rugs and the cleaner. \nDavis said many finer rugs are more delicate, so look to see if the machine has a gentler setting or comes with dedicated tools for these areas. The same goes for high-end wood floors, he said, as aggressive brushes can scratch the finish. Heavyweight uprights can also eventually mar wood, he adds. \nAlthough upright machines are most popular in the U.S., Singer and Davis recommend canister types because they're lighter and have options for different tools. They especially recommend them for wood floors, as they're less likely to scratch. Their top picks are Miele and SEBO, citing longevity and long warranties. Among the top-selling machines are Miele's HomeCare series (starting at $499, www.miele.com for dealers) and SEBO's Airbelt line, (starting at $589, www.sebo.us). \nVacuuming pet hair can be a tricky thing, Davis said. Users will likely need to go over surfaces a few times and may need to vacuum more often. This is where extra tools can come in handy, such as those to clean upholstery. Canisters have these tools, as do uprights like the Dyson Ball Animal 2. ($399, www.dyson.com) \nSinger and Levesque said allergy suffers should look for cleaners with HEPA filters, but also ensure the machine itself is sealed completely to avoid dust getting out through crevices. Sealed machines are more expensive. \n\"Cheaper machines don't have the sealed filtration,\" Singer said.  ",

      "text": "  Pink furniture fills the Spring High Point Market By PATRICIA SHERIDAN Pittsburgh Post-Gazette   HIGH POINT, N.C. \nHome furnishings were blushing at the Spring High Point Market. Pink was prominent in all its hues, emerging as interior design's top tone for the season. \nYou didn't need a trained eye to pick up this color trend; it was in enough showrooms to give Jaipur, India's Pink City, competition. But be aware: Like the rosy cheeks of youth, this too may fade. So if pink is your preference, now is the time to go shopping. \nHere is a sampling of lamps, furniture, upholstery and other accessories in shades from soft to shocking: \nRachel Ashwell, the designer and founder of Shabby Chic, showed her Lloyd sofa with very soft pink cushions upholstered in blush velvet on a wood frame. \nGoing bolder on the color wheel was Worlds Away's faux shagreen pink poufs on a brass base. \nPine Cone Hill, which is known for textiles and bedding, displayed new Flamingo motif sheets and duvet covers on a shocking pink four-poster bed. Designer and owner Annie Selke recently moved to Marrakesh Country Club, a golf community in Palm Desert, Calif., that is famous for its pink buildings. \n\"It served as the inspiration for my new Palm Springs collection, and I like to say that the area had me at pink,\" she said, noting that her Flamingo bedding was also inspired by the artwork of a Parisian atelier. \n\"You look at the bedding and it just makes you feel happy.\" \nIn Facet, Michelle Workman's new collection for French Heritage, she used a pink faux shagreen on her Bellini drinks table. It comes in other colors as well. \nBarbara Cosgrove showed boy and girl figurine lamps in a resin finished in a matte pink with shades lined in the same color. \nEven makers of outdoor furniture were in the pink. Brown Jordan had its Deia outdoor sofa on display in hot pink with Kelly green accents. It also looked good in white with pink cushions. \nKindel Furniture, which has been made in the U.S. since 1901, manufactures the Dorothy Draper and Winterthur collections. Both used a variety of pinks on tables, chests and upholstery. \n\"Pink is just a generally uplifting and happy color that is perfect for home furnishings and decor, and it always brings a smile to my face,\" said Selke.

      "text": "\nMonday’s unveiling of Chris Holtmann as the Ohio State men’s basketball coach came with plenty of fanfare. But amid the good vibes and talk from players of getting an exciting new era underway came a few words of caution from athletic director Gene Smith.\nHe didn’t wait long: They came in his opening remarks.\n“The 2017-18 season will be a year of transition that will require all of us to be supportive and patient,” he said.\nSmith’s remarks underscored the reality that Holtmann inherits a roster that, although comprised of players who seem to present few locker-room worries, is short on numbers and was widely expected to finish in the bottom third of an increasingly deep Big Ten.\nNo player on the roster has been named anything higher than honorable mention all-Big Ten. Of the nine recruited scholarship players, only six have played for the Buckeyes, with a third of the roster consisting of two freshmen and Derek Funderburk, who redshirted last season.\nNearly half their scoring and rebounding is gone — 47.6 percent and 48.1 percent.\nAlthough Ohio State is low on bodies and proven production, senior Jae’Sean Tate said this season’s team will be unified after two years of empty promises from players no longer around.\n“Honestly, like the year before, we want guys who want to be here and who are willing to work hard,” Tate said after Holtmann’s news conference. “It actually was a sigh of relief because I knew everyone around me was here for the right reasons. There was just a different vibe in the weight room.”\nIt’s a similar message to what was repeated after the Buckeyes lost four freshmen before the 2016 offseason was more than a few days old. After last season’s 17-15 record, Marc Loving ran out of eligibility, Trevor Thompson declared early for the NBA, David Bell transferred to be with his pregnant girlfriend and JaQuan Lyle quit the team for a second straight year only to have it stick this time.\nThe return of a healthy Keita Bates-Diop, who will take a medical redshirt for last season, will provide a boost. But projecting a return to the NCAA Tournament after consecutive misses wasn’t something Holtmann was prepared to do.\n“I’m not going to put a timetable (on that),” he said. “We’re going to work every day to obviously play in the best tournament in the world, I can promise you that.”\nGiven the reality of the situation, it might be the most realistic goal for the season.\n ",

Western Michigan University-Cooley Law School asked in January for his conviction to be set aside, and the Wayne County prosecutor's office agreed. \nThe law school's Innocence Project says police used a single hair to tie Watkins to the killing. The prosecutor's office says conclusions made in the 1970s don't match current scientific standards. \nWatkins is now 61 years old. He was 20 when he was sentenced in 1976 to life without parole for first-degree murder.  ",

(AP) - There may be no more potent reminder of California's humongous snowfall than the plows still clearing roads that snake across the state's highest mountains as summer approaches. \nCrews have been digging, blowing and blasting for months - and the work is not finished, though an approaching heat wave could speed up the process. \n\"We're almost at the middle of June and we still have lots of passes that aren't open,\" said Florene Trainor, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation. \nFew roads traverse the Sierra Nevada, the rocky spine running 400 miles up the state that is home to Yosemite National Park. Mountain passes are typically open by Memorial Day. \nThe only road through Yosemite, Highway 120, remained closed this week as crews dig out from snows that topped 20 feet and drifted well over 50 feet. \nOn a recent day, the park's entrance station at 9,945-foot high Tioga Pass was buried in snow. \nBut the serenity of the Sierra Nevada, with birds chirping beneath snow-crested peaks that tower above 12,000 feet, was shaken by the roar and beep of plows, excavators and massive machines carving through 15-foot snowbanks and moving giant blocks of snow. Big snow blowers sent plumes arcing through the air and off the side of the road. \nAs the Caltrans crew dug the entrance out from the east, a crew from the park was working from the west to clear the road that winds its way to Yosemite Valley, the park's top destination. \nCaltrans had begun inching its way up the road more than two months ago when it seemed more like winter. It snowed on and off throughout the spring, with a late-season storm hitting last weekend. \nThe air is clean and views are stunning, but working here is not for the faint of heart as drivers maneuver large machines along narrow ribbons that feel suspended above an abyss. Helicopter footage shot this spring for Caltrans showed the small margin for error in places where the road clung to cliffs and then vanished under a white blanket where the path was obscured. \n\"It's spooky, it's nerve-wracking ... especially when you can't see the road. You're on a big sled,\" said Clint Weier, a maintenance superintendent with Caltrans. \"Some of our operators up here have had some wow factors.\" \nAvalanches stampede down granite walls, taking trees and rocks with them that choke roads. In one section, tree trunks and branches from a previous slide poked from sheer snowbanks littered with pine needles and other debris from a previous snow slide. \nRockslides pose a threat even after workers use charges and other methods to release snow slides to alleviate the danger. Slides and the crushing weight of the snowpack damaged guardrails in some places that serve as the lone barrier between the road and a precipitous drop that plunges hundreds of feet east of the park entrance. \nA Yosemite plow driver was killed by an avalanche in 1995 and now maintenance workers in the park complete avalanche safety courses to work on the road, park spokesman Scott Gediman said. \nThe park's official map notes that the eastern entrance atop the state's highest automobile pass is typically closed through May, but it usually opens later after a snowy winter, Gediman said Tuesday. There's no date yet to open the road through the park. \nJust to the north of the park, Sonora Pass opened Tuesday. Ebbetts Pass farther north remains closed, said Skip Allum, a Caltrans spokesman. To the south, crews plowed the road over Minaret Summit near Mammoth Mountain ski area. \nIn Lassen Volcanic National Park, much farther north, deep snow still buries the road that circles the southernmost peak in the Cascade Range. The road is expected to open in early July. \nThe snowpack presented an additional challenge this year because it was heavily saturated with water. The dense and frozen snow was harder to cut through, heavier to move and broke equipment, Paul Jensen, a Caltrans plow driver, said. \nJensen has been working overtime all spring to get the road into Yosemite open and hasn't minded working weekends. He considers it a labor of love. \n\"Twenty years and I'm still not tired of it,\" Jensen said. \"It's my favorite time of the year.\" \n___ \nMelley reported from Los Angeles.

He also said the U.S. wants to secure its borders to \"bolster U.S. national security\" as part of the agenda of President Donald Trump. \nHe says the goal of the U.S. in the region is to \"create the prosperity we all want.\" He said that must include ways to reduce the number of people working in the informal sector and make it easier for people to start new business in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. \nTillerson says, \"What happens in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala directly affects the security and economic interests of the United States and other countries in the region,\" he said. \nHe spoke at the opening session of the Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is meeting with leaders of Central America and senior officials from Mexico as President Donald Trump signals a policy shift toward the region. \nTillerson is taking part in discussions in Miami aimed at improving the economies of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Vice President Mike Pence was expected to address the conference later Thursday at Florida International University. \nThe conference will shift to a focus on security Friday. \nThe conference comes as the Trump administration has dismayed experts on the region with a proposed 30 percent cut in foreign assistance to the three countries. His administration is also taking a harder line on illegal immigration and weighing whether to end temporary protected status for around 200,000 Central Americans in the U.S.  ",

Dutch Finance Minister and head of the eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem arrives for a meeting at the office of the European Stability Mechanism in Luxembourg on Thursday, June 15, 2017. Eurogroup finance ministers meet ... By PAN PYLASAssociated Press \nLUXEMBOURG (AP) - Greece is trying Thursday to convince its creditors that it's done enough to get its hands on more rescue money as well as a detailed plan for how its massive debt burden can be eased once its current bailout program ends next year. \nGiven that the Greek government has delivered on a wide array of economic reforms that were required for the payout of the next installment of rescue loans, there appears to be little doubt that the country will be cleared to get its next batch of bailout funds. \nAs a result, the main point of interest of Thursday's meeting of eurozone finance ministers is on the debt relief discussions. \nUnder the terms of its 2015 bailout deal, Greece's European creditors had promised to provide cash and find a way to lighten the country's long-term debt load - as long as it kept a lid on spending and deeply reformed the economy. \nThe eurozone's top official, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, sought to downplay expectations that the full-scale of the debt relief on offer will emerge Thursday. \n\"Today we will give more clarity to Greece,\" he said as he joined the gathering in Luxembourg. \"There won't be a figure that rolls out of that. The figure will only come right at the end of the program.\" \nDijsselbloem said he hoped the meeting will mark a \"very positive step forward\" that builds on \"the huge effort that Greece has put in.\" Greece's creditors, he added, were \"preparing Greece for the end of the program,\" when Greece would have to finance itself for the first time since 2010 by borrowing money from international bond markets. \n\"It is a new phase,\" he said. \nThough the meeting won't see any final decisions on the size of the debt relief, Dijsselbloem said discussions will center on what kind of measures will be offered. \nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has repeatedly said that debt relief is necessary to get the Greek economy back on track and has indicated that he would be prepared to request a summit of eurozone leaders if no debt relief deal is secured Thursday. \nDespite years of austerity since Greece was first bailed out in 2010, the country's debt burden still stands at about 320 billion euros ($360 billion), or around 180 percent of annual gross domestic product. That's largely because the Greek economy has contracted by around a quarter, meaning a worsening in the debt load even at a time when the country's budget has improved markedly. \nAn outright cut in Greece's debt is not allowed under euro rules, but the length of time the country has in paying back its debts can be extended, and the interest rates on those debts can be cut. For Greece, that would limit the amount it has to pay out on debt servicing each year, money it can use for the benefit of the Greek economy and society. \nPierre Moscovici, the European Union's top economy official said it's time for the Greek people to see the \"light at the end of the tunnel of austerity\" and that this Eurogroup meeting could be \"very positive for Greece and the Greek people.\" \nOne of the reasons why Greece's bailout program has stalled over the past few months has been a disagreement between the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund on debt relief. The IMF, which has contributed financially to Greece's first two bailouts but not the third, has wanted more information about what debt relief Greece may get before it gets more involved in the current program. \nGermany, for one, has been insistent on IMF participation and that's held up the latest disbursement to Greece. \nGerman Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who has been instrumental in the austerity demanded of Greece in return for money, largely from Berlin, said he was \"optimistic\" a deal on the disbursement will be clinched but was more guarded when it came to discussing debt relief. \nGreece has been living under austerity for more than seven years and its left-led coalition government recently legislated further cost cuts, including to pensions, in hopes of getting the long-delayed loan installment. It needs the money to meet roughly 7 billion euros ($7.8 billion) in debt repayments in July. \nThe Greek government, whose popularity has fallen sharply as it imposed more austerity measures, faced more criticism Thursday when more than 2,000 elderly protesters marched through central Athens to demonstrate against pension cuts. \n\"We can't live on 300 euros\" they chanted, with some waving sticks. \n___ \nIoanna Spanou contributed from Athens.

Each boat had over 130 migrants aboard. \nIn a separate operation, she said 11 people, including a 2-month-old baby with asthma, were rescued from a wooden boat. \nLibya is one of the prime spots for smugglers to launch boats - many unseaworthy - packed with migrants and refugees desperate to reach Europe. At least 1,808 have died this year trying to cross the Mediterranean.  ",

The blast sent people flying several meters (yards) into the air, Shi was quoted as saying. \nKindergartens in China have been targeted before in apparent revenge attacks carried out by mentally ill people or those bearing grudges against their neighbors and society. \nVideos purportedly from the scene and posted on social media showed children and adults lying on the ground, some bleeding. Clothing, shoes and other items were strewn on the ground beside pools of blood. The videos showed ambulances arriving and medics wheeling people into an emergency room. \nThe Xuzhou government said two people died at the scene and five others died at a hospital. At least four others were seriously injured, it said. \nCalls to the kindergarten and local hospitals rang unanswered. \nIn 2010, nearly 20 children were killed in attacks on schools, prompting a response from top government officials and leading many schools to beef up security with the posting of guards and the installation of gates and other barriers. Last year, a knife-wielding assailant injured seven students outside a primary school in a northern city. \nChina maintains tight control over firearms and most attacks are carried out using knives, axes or homemade explosives.

      "text": "Somali survivors tell of restaurant siege by rebels; 31 dead 2017-06-15T05:02:09Z By ABDI GULEDAssociated Press \nMOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) - Islamic extremists attacked a popular Somalia restaurant in an overnight siege and killed 31 people - many at point-blank range - before they were slain by security forces, police said Thursday. \nSurvivors described harrowing scenes of hiding under tables and behind curtains as the five gunmen hunted for victims in the darkened Pizza House restaurant. Nearly 40 people were wounded. \nAl-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack, which began Wednesday evening with a car bomb exploding at the gate to the restaurant and ended when troops secured the site after dawn, said senior police Capt. Mohamed Hussein. \n\"I never thought I would have the chance to see the sun again. They were killing people on sight,\" university student Saida Hussein told The Associated Press. She said she survived by hiding behind a large table. \nSoldiers in gun-mounted vehicles surrounded the building, and troops later entered the ground floor as al-Shabab snipers defended their positions upstairs. The battle to end the siege was hampered by darkness, Hussein said. \nAden Karie said he was wounded by an attacker who spotted him moving behind a curtain. \n\"He shot at me twice, and one bullet struck me on the leg,\" Karie said as he was taken to an ambulance. \nThe bodies of five girls believed to have been killed by the extremists were found in the restaurant, police said. The body of a Syrian man who worked as a chef lay near a blood-spattered and bullet-marked wall. \nThe car bomb that began the attack blew the roofs off the restaurant and other nearby buildings. Many of the first victims were young men who had been entering the Pizza House when the bomb went off, Hussein said. \nThe extremists, appearing to pose as security forces, then rushed inside the restaurant. \nThe gunmen \"were dressed in military uniforms. They forced those fleeing the site to go inside,\" witness Nur Yasin told the AP. \nA neighboring restaurant, Posh Treats, which is frequented by the city's elite, was damaged in the blast, security officials said. Security forces rescued Asian, Ethiopian, Kenyan and other workers at Posh Treats as the attack continued, Hussein said. \nPresident Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed called the victims \"martyrs\" and noted that the attack came during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The United States mission to Somalia said many of the victims had been breaking their daily Ramadan fast when the attack began. \nRamadan \"is a time of spiritual reflection and increased piety, which makes the timing of this attack all the more atrocious,\" the U.S. statement said. \nSomalia-based al-Shabab often targets high-profile areas of Mogadishu, including hotels, military checkpoints and areas near the presidential palace. It has vowed to step up attacks after the recently elected government launched a new military offensive against it. \nAl-Shabab was the deadliest Islamic extremist group in Africa last year, killing more than 4,200 people, according to the Washington-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies. \nThe extremist group also faces a new military push from the United States after President Donald Trump approved expanded operations, including airstrikes. On Sunday, the U.S. military in Africa said it conducted an airstrike in southern Somalia that killed eight extremists at a rebel command and logistics camp. \nSomalia's president confirmed the airstrike and said such attacks would disrupt the group's ability to conduct new operations. \nPressure is growing on Somalia's military to assume full security responsibilities for the country. The 22,000-member African Union multinational force, AMISOM, which has been supporting the fragile central government, plans to start withdrawing in 2018 and leave by the end of 2020.  ",

      "text": "\nThe longer Archie Miller won games at the University of Dayton, the greater the perception grew that Thad Matta’s eventual replacement would come from the Gem City. And like many things that are widely assumed to be true, one kernel of truth did emerge from the prophecy.\nJoin the conversation at Facebook.com/BuckeyeXtra and connect with us on Twitter @BuckeyeXtra\nIt was in Dayton, sometime Thursday morning, that Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith, Butler men’s basketball coach Chris Holtmann and their respective wives had an in-person meeting at an undisclosed location that culminated with the Buckeyes landing the 14th coach in program history. The decision capped a search that did not officially get underway until right after the June 5 press conference announcing Matta’s firing and one that was delayed at least once to what Smith described as “trepidation” on Holtmann’s part.\n“That’s as swift and fast as I could move,” Smith said at Monday’s news conference introducing Holtmann as the new coach.\nThe process started with a June 2 meeting between Smith and Matta during which Smith said it became evident that a change in leadership was necessary for the program. Smith went to Chicago the following day for Big Ten meetings and built a profile of what he was looking for in a new coach, complete with financial parameters and a strategy for how to proceed. He met with university president Michael Drake on Sunday to discuss the start of the search.\nOnce Drake signed off on what Smith presented, he enlisted the help of Eddie Fogler, a friend and former coach who runs a search firm. But Smith could not start actually vetting candidates and making calls until after a June 5 news conference, one Smith said was designed to pay tribute to Matta’s 13 seasons with the Buckeyes.\nBy the end of the night, Holtmann was the top candidate. But he wasn’t on board at first.\n“This was a decision that I had to work through, and I will say this: Gene was aggressive and persistent in his approach and I really appreciated that,” Holtmann said.\nThe initial offer extended Tuesday was for seven years, Smith said. Holtmann did not accept, and as a result Smith kept searching.\n“He needed time to think and I needed to move because I wasn’t sure what he was going to do,” Smith said of Holtmann.\nWednesday, Smith interviewed Ohio State assistant Chris Jent for the position. That night, Smith was in Omaha, Nebraska, to meet with Creighton coach Greg McDermott. He is not believed to have been officially offered the job, and after about three hours’ worth of sleep Smith was in a car pointed toward Dayton.\nThe two sides ultimately agreed on an eight-year deal that was announced Friday, and Holtmann came to Columbus to meet with his new players.\n“It was something I had to deliberate on, for sure,” Holtmann said. “There have been other opportunities that have come along, but this is the only one I seriously considered. I left a special program and special guys. That was emotional for me, but I’m telling you, the vision he had and what he was looking for and this place, I’m extremely excited.”\n ",

Firefighters work at the scene after a deadly blaze at a high rise apartment block in London, Wednesday, June 14, 2017. Fire swept through a high-rise apartment building in west London early Wednesday, killing an unknown numb... By DANICA KIRKAAssociated Press \nLONDON (AP) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered a full public inquiry into the high-rise apartment blaze that killed at least 17 people in London amid growing public anxiety about whether similar blazes could occur in other housing blocks around the country. \nMay moved quickly to establish exactly what caused the fire - and why it moved so quickly, engulfing the building that housed as many as 600 people in less than an hour. \nFire safety engineers were stunned at the pace in which flames tore through the 120-apartment Grenfell Tower early Wednesday when most people were asleep. Senior fire officials described the progression of the fire as unprecedented. \n\"We need to know what happened,\" a resolute May said. \"We need to know an explanation. We owe that to the families, to the people who have lost loved ones and the homes in which they lived.\" \nLondon firefighters, many traumatized by the devastation, worked Thursday to make the building safe so they could continue searching for more victims. Entire families are still missing, and the death toll is certain to rise. The apartment tower is so huge there is still no exact count of the missing. \nIn addition, 74 people were injured in the blaze, with 37 hospitalized and 17 of them still in critical condition. \nFire Commissioner Dany Cotton said it would be a \"miracle\" if anyone else were to be found alive. \nIt is unsafe for firefighters to go into parts of the 24-story tower, so the fire department is working with structural engineers to shore up the building so they can complete a \"finger-tip search\" of the entire structure, Cotton said. Structures may need to be erected inside the torched building to make it safe enough to search. Cotton said specialist dogs would also be brought in to help the search. \nMore stories of residents' desperation during the catastrophe emerged. \nFirefighters trying to race into the building were protected from falling debris by police officers, who placed riot shields over their heads. One woman threw a baby out the window to escape the flames. Others tossed small children. Some adults jumped. Their fates were unclear at this time. \n\"I spoke to one of my officers, who was very near when someone came out the window, and he was in tears. And he is a professional fire officer,\" Cotton told Sky News. \"We like to think of ourselves as 'roughty, toughty' and heroes - they are heroes - but they have feelings. People were absolutely devastated by yesterday's events.\" \nMore than 200 firefighters worked through the night at the public housing block. Now that the heavy black smoke has cleared, the public could only gape at the huge burned-out hulk in west London's working-class, multi-ethnic North Kensington neighborhood. \nA tenants' group had complained for years about the risk of a fire in the building. The cause of the fire is under investigation, and authorities have refused to speculate on what could have started the blaze. But the focus has turned to renovations completed last year that added decorative touches to the building. \nThe renovation project included the installation of insulated exterior cladding, double-glazed windows and a communal heating system. Fire experts say the investigators will need to look at what materials were used and who approved their use. \nThe London Fire Brigade said it received the first reports of the blaze at 12:54 a.m. and the first engines arrived within six minutes. Survivors told of frantic attempts to escape. \n\"The flames, I have never seen anything like it. It just reminded me of 9/11,\" said Muna Ali, 45. \"The fire started on the upper floors. ... Oh my goodness, it spread so quickly. It had completely spread within half an hour.\" \nMore than 1 million pounds ($1.27 million) has been raised to help victims of the tragedy as volunteers and charities worked through the night to find shelter, food and clothes for people who had lost everything. \nSt. Clement's Notting Dale, a church near the tower, has turned into an informal center for people searching for friends and family. \nLaminated signs bearing missing peoples' phone numbers are tied to the fence next to notices from happier times advertising the Summer Fete with its barbecue, children's games and giant slide. A handwritten sign reads \"breakfast from 0800 inside.\" The church is also serving lunch and dinner to survivors. \nOn a utility box by the church's front door, residents have taped signs looking for information about Khadija Saye, last seen on the 20th floor, and Mariem Elggwahry, last seen on the 19th floor at 2:30 am. \nA massive white poster has been placed on a wall nearby and people offered messages of hope and condolence in many languages, including English, Arabic and Spanish. \n\"Praying for auntie,\" one message read. \nCommunity centers in London have been overwhelmed by the number of donations flooding in for those left homeless. So much food, clothing, shoes and other items have been coming in that the centers, churches and mosques have had to start turning away new donations. One heaving table at a local church came with a note: \"Help yourself.\" \nMissing people posters have been put up throughout North Kensington. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has offered free food for survivors at one of his nearby eateries. \nMany were moved to tears Wednesday at a moment of silence outside the Notting Hill Methodist Church in west London. \n\"There are times when all the words we can say are not adequate. And sometimes words fail us because no words can do justice to how we feel, or what we have seen or what has happened. Today is one of those days,\" Rev. Mike Long said. \n\"What we can simply do is look to all that we have seen today - which is good, which is fabulous - people getting together.\" \nNone of the 17 victims have been identified so far. \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Frank Griffiths contributed to this report.
