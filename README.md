ANONSMENT

An application to meet and chat new people anonymously.

Life is much easier when there is someone with whom we could confide our problems, our worries and letâ€™s just say our feelings. But the fear of being judged, laughed at can make many of us to bottle up our feelings which eventually spoils our peace and could be dreadful for our health.

How about we help you to find someone to talk to? Someone who could help you to create a window to open up and share your feelings? Anonsment is an app specifically made for people to make confessions anonymously and share their feelings with another human who can understand your feelings and share their views.
